[clop clop clop] \\nSOLDIER #1: Halt!  Who goes there?\\nARTHUR: It is I, Arthur, son of Uther Pendragon, from the castle of Camelot.  King of the Britons, defeator of the Saxons, sovereign of all England!\\nSOLDIER #1: Pull the other one!\\nARTHUR: I am, ...  and this is my trusty servant Patsy.  We have ridden the length and breadth of the land in search of knights who will join me in my court at Camelot.  I must speak with your lord and master.\\nSOLDIER #1: What?  Ridden on a horse?\\nARTHUR: Yes!\\nSOLDIER #1: You\\'re using coconuts!\\nARTHUR: What?\\nSOLDIER #1: You\\'ve got two empty halves of coconut and you\\'re bangin\\' \\'em together.\\nARTHUR: So?  We have ridden since the snows of winter covered this land, through the kingdom of Mercea, through--\\nSOLDIER #1: Where\\'d you get the coconuts?\\nARTHUR: We found them.\\nSOLDIER #1: Found them?  In Mercea?  The coconut\\'s tropical!\\nARTHUR: What do you mean?\\nSOLDIER #1: Well, this is a temperate zone.\\nARTHUR: The swallow may fly south with the sun or the house martin or the plover may seek warmer climes in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land?\\nSOLDIER #1: Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?\\nARTHUR: Not at all.  They could be carried.\\nSOLDIER #1: What?  A swallow carrying a coconut?\\nARTHUR: It could grip it by the husk!\\nSOLDIER #1: It\\'s not a question of where he grips it!  It\\'s a simple question of weight ratios!  A five ounce bird could not carry a one pound coconut.\\nARTHUR: Well, it doesn\\'t matter.  Will you go and tell your master that Arthur from the Court of Camelot is here.\\nSOLDIER #1: Listen.  In order to maintain air-speed velocity, a swallow needs to beat its wings forty-three times every second, right?\\nARTHUR: Please!\\nSOLDIER #1: Am I right?\\nARTHUR: I\\'m not interested!\\nSOLDIER #2: It could be carried by an African swallow!\\nSOLDIER #1: Oh, yeah, an African swallow maybe, but not a European swallow.  That\\'s my point.\\nSOLDIER #2: Oh, yeah, I agree with that.\\nARTHUR: Will you ask your master if he wants to join my court at Camelot?!\\nSOLDIER #1: But then of course a-- African swallows are non-migratory.\\nSOLDIER #2: Oh, yeah...\\nSOLDIER #1: So they couldn\\'t bring a coconut back anyway...

And how d\\'you get that, eh?  By exploiting the workers!  By \\'anging on to outdated imperialist dogma which perpetuates the economic and social differences in our society.  If there\\'s ever going to be any progress with the--\\nWOMAN: Dennis, there\\'s some lovely filth down here.  Oh!  How d\\'you do?\\nARTHUR: How do you do, good lady.  I am Arthur, King of the Britons.  Who\\'s castle is that?\\nWOMAN: King of the who?\\nARTHUR: The Britons.\\nWOMAN: Who are the Britons?\\nARTHUR: Well, we all are.  We are all Britons, and I am your king.\\nWOMAN: I didn\\'t know we had a king.  I thought we were an autonomous collective.\\nDENNIS: You\\'re fooling yourself.  We\\'re living in a dictatorship.  A self-perpetuating autocracy in which the working classes--\\nWOMAN: Oh, there you go, bringing class into it again.\\nDENNIS: That\\'s what it\\'s all about.  If only people would hear of--\\nARTHUR: Please, please good people.  I am in haste.  Who lives in that castle?\\nWOMAN: No one live there.\\nARTHUR: Then who is your lord?\\nWOMAN: We don\\'t have a lord.\\nARTHUR: What?\\nDENNIS: I told you.  We\\'re an anarcho-syndicalist commune.  We take it in turns to act as a sort of executive officer for the week.\\nARTHUR: Yes.\\nDENNIS: But all the decision of that officer have to be ratified at a special bi-weekly meeting--\\nARTHUR: Yes, I see.\\nDENNIS: By a simple majority in the case of purely internal affairs,--\\nARTHUR: Be quiet!\\nDENNIS: But by a two-thirds majority in the case of more major--\\nARTHUR: Be quiet!  I order you to be quiet!\\nWOMAN: Order, eh?  Who does he think he is?  Heh.\\nARTHUR: I am your king!\\nWOMAN: Well, I didn\\'t vote for you.\\nARTHUR: You don\\'t vote for kings.\\nWOMAN: Well, how did you become king then?\\nARTHUR: The Lady of the Lake, ... [angels sing] ... her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water signifying by Divine Providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur. [singing stops] That is why I am your king!\\nDENNIS: Listen, strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government.  Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.\\nARTHUR: Be quiet!\\nDENNIS: Well, but you can\\'t expect to wield supreme executive power just \\'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you!\\nARTHUR: Shut up!\\nDENNIS: I mean, if I went \\'round saying I was an emperor just because some moistened bint had lobbed a scimitar at me, they\\'d put me away!\\nARTHUR: Shut up, will you.  Shut up!\\nDENNIS: Ah, now we see the violence inherent in the system.\\nARTHUR: Shut up!\\nDENNIS: Oh!  Come and see the violence inherent in the system!  Help, help!  I\\'m being repressed!\\nARTHUR: Bloody peasant!\\nDENNIS: Oh, what a give-away.  Did you hear that?  Did you hear that, eh?  That\\'s what I\\'m on about.  Did you see him repressing me?

Together they formed a band whose names and deeds were to be retold throughout the centuries: the Knights of the Round Table\\nSCENE 6: [clop clop clop] \\nSIR BEDEVERE: And that, my liege, is how we know the earth to be banana-shaped.\\nARTHUR: This new learning amazes me, Sir Bedevere.

We dine well here in Camelot.  We eat ham and jam and spam a lot [dancing] We\\'re knights of the Round Table. Our shows are formidable, But many times we\\'re given rhymes That are quite unsingable. We\\'re opera mad in Camelot. We sing from the diaphragm a lot [in dungeon] \\nPRISONER: [clap clap clap clap] [in medieval hall] \\nKNIGHTS: [tap-dancing] In war we\\'re tough and able, Quite indefatigable.  Between our quests we sequin vests and impersonate Clark Gable.

If he will give us food and shelter for the night he can join us in our quest for the Holy Grail.\\nFRENCH GUARD: Well, I\\'ll ask him, but I don\\'t think he\\'ll be very keen.  Uh, he\\'s already got one, you see?\\nARTHUR: What?\\nGALAHAD: He says they\\'ve already got one!\\nARTHUR: Are you sure he\\'s got one?\\nFRENCH GUARD: Oh, yes, it\\'s very nice-a.

The ferocity of the French taunting took him completely by surprise, and Arthur became convinced that a new strategy was required if the quest for the Holy Grail were to be brought to a successful conclusion.  Arthur, having consulted his closest knights, decided that they should separate, and search for the Grail individually. [clop clop clop] Now, this is what they did: Launcelot--\\nKNIGHT: Aaaah!

He was not afraid to die, O brave Sir Robin.  He was not at all afraid to be killed in nasty ways.  Brave, brave, brave, brave Sir Robin!

To have his kneecaps split, and his body burned away, And his limbs all hacked and mangled, brave Sir Robin!\\nHis head smashed in and his heart cut out, And his liver removed and his bowels unplugged, And his nostrils raped and his bottom burned off, And his pen--\\nSIR ROBIN: That\\'s-- that\\'s, uh-- that\\'s enough music for now, lads.

Open the door! [pound pound pound] In the name of King Arthur, open the door! [squeak] [thump] [squeak] [boom] \\nGIRLS: Hello!\\nZOOT: Welcome gentle Sir Knight.  Welcome to the Castle Anthrax.\\nGALAHAD: The Castle Anthrax?\\nZOOT: Yes.  Oh, it\\'s not a very good name is it?  Oh, but we are nice and we will attend to your every, every need!\\nGALAHAD: You are the keepers of the Holy Grail?\\nZOOT: The what?\\nGALAHAD: The Grail.  It is here.\\nZOOT: Oh, but you are tired, and you must rest awhile.  Midget!  Crapper!\\nMIDGET and CRAPPER: Yes, O Zoot?\\nZOOT: Prepare a bed for our guest.\\nMIDGET and CRAPPER: Oh thank you!  Thank you!  Thank you!  Thank you!  Thank you!  Thank you! ...\\nZOOT: Away, away varletesses.  The beds here are warm and soft, and very, very big.\\nGALAHAD: Well, look, I-- I-- uh--\\nZOOT: What is your name, handsome knight?\\nGALAHAD: Sir Galahad...  the Chaste.\\nZOOT: Mine is Zoot.  Just Zoot.  Oh, but come.\\nGALAHAD: Look, please!  In God\\'s name, show me the Grail!\\nZOOT: Oh, you have suffered much.  You are delirious.\\nGALAHAD: No, look.  I have seen it!  It is here, in this--\\nZOOT: Sir Galahad!  You would not be so ungallant as to refuse our hospitality.\\nGALAHAD: Well, I-- I-- uh--\\nZOOT: Oh, I am afraid our life must seem very dull and quiet compared to yours.  We are but eight score young blondes and brunettes, all between sixteen and nineteen-and-a-half, cut off in this castle with no one to protect us.  Oooh.  It is a lonely life: bathing, dressing, undressing, making exciting underwear.  We are just not used to handsome knights.  Nay.  Nay.  Come.  Come.  You may lie here.  Oh, but you are wounded!\\nGALAHAD: No, no-- it\\'s-- it\\'s nothing.\\nZOOT: Oh, you must see the doctors immediately!  No, no, please!  Lie down. [clap clap] \\nPIGLET: Well, what seems to be the trouble?\\nGALAHAD: They\\'re doctors?!\\nZOOT: Uh, they have a basic medical training, yes.\\nGALAHAD: B-- but--\\nZOOT: Oh, come, come.  You must try to rest.  Doctor Piglet!  Doctor Winston!  Practice your art.\\nWINSTON: Try to relax.\\nGALAHAD: Are you sure that\\'s absolutely necessary?\\nPIGLET: We must examine you.\\nGALAHAD: There\\'s nothing wrong with that!\\nPIGLET: Please.  We are doctors.\\nGALAHAD: Look!  This cannot be.  I am sworn to chastity.\\nPIGLET: Back to your bed!  At once!\\nGALAHAD: Torment me no longer.  I have seen the Grail!\\nPIGLET: There\\'s no grail here.\\nGALAHAD: I have seen it!  I have seen it! [clank] I have seen--\\nGIRLS: Hello.\\nGALAHAD: Oh.\\nGIRLS: Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.

I have seen it, here in this castle!\\nDINGO: Oh no.  Oh, no!  Bad, bad Zoot!\\nGALAHAD: Well, what is it?\\nDINGO: Oh, wicked, bad, naughty Zoot!  She has been setting alight to our beacon, which, I have just remembered, is grail-shaped.  It\\'s not the first time we\\'ve had this problem.\\nGALAHAD: It\\'s not the real Grail?\\nDINGO: Oh, wicked, bad, naughty, evil Zoot!  She is a bad person and must pay the penalty.  Do you think this scene should have been cut?  We were so worried when the boys were writing it, but now, we\\'re glad.  It\\'s better than some of the previous scenes, I think.\\nLEFT HEAD: At least ours was better visually.\\nDENNIS: Well, at least ours was committed.  It wasn\\'t just a string of pussy jokes.\\nOLD MAN: Get on with it.\\nTIM THE ENCHANTER: Yes, get on with it!\\nARMY OF KNIGHTS: Yes, get on with it!\\nDINGO: Oh, I am enjoying this scene.\\nGOD: Get on with it!\\nDINGO: [sigh] Oh, wicked, wicked Zoot.  Oh, she is a naughty person, and she must pay the penalty.  And here in Castle Anthrax, we have but one punishment for setting alight the grail-shaped beacon.  You must tie her down on a bed and spank her.\\nGIRLS: A spanking!  A spanking!\\nDINGO: You must spank her well.  And after you have spanked her, you may deal with her as you like.  And then, spank me.\\nAMAZING: And spank me.\\nSTUNNER: And me.\\nLOVELY: And me.\\nDINGO: Yes, yes, you must give us all a good spanking!\\nGIRLS: A spanking!  A spanking!  There is going to be a spanking tonight!\\nDINGO: And after the spanking, the oral sex.\\nGIRLS: The oral sex!  The oral sex!\\nGALAHAD: Well, I could stay a bit longer.\\nLAUNCELOT: Sir Galahad!\\nGALAHAD: Oh, hello.\\nLAUNCELOT: Quick!\\nGALAHAD: What?\\nLAUNCELOT: Quick!\\nGALAHAD: Why?\\nLAUNCELOT: You are in great peril!\\nDINGO: No he isn\\'t.\\nLAUNCELOT: Silence, foul temptress!\\nGALAHAD: You know, she\\'s got a point.\\nLAUNCELOT: Come on!  We will cover your escape!\\nGALAHAD: Look, I\\'m fine!\\nLAUNCELOT: Come on!\\nGIRLS: Sir Galahad!\\nGALAHAD: No.  Look, I can tackle this lot single-handed!\\nDINGO: Yes!  Let him tackle us single-handed!\\nGIRLS: Yes!  Let him tackle us single-handed!\\nLAUNCELOT: No, Sir Galahad.  Come on!\\nGALAHAD: No!  Really!  Honestly, I can cope.  I can handle this lot easily.\\nDINGO: Oh, yes.  Let him handle us easily.\\nGIRLS: Yes.  Let him handle us easily.\\nLAUNCELOT: No.  Quick!  Quick!\\nGALAHAD: Please!  I can defeat them!  There\\'s only a hundred-and-fifty of them!\\nDINGO: Yes, yes!  He will beat us easily!  We haven\\'t a chance.\\nGIRLS: We haven\\'t a chance.  He will beat us easily... [boom] \\nDINGO: Oh, shit.\\nLAUNCELOT: We were in the nick of time.  You were in great peril.\\nGALAHAD: I don\\'t think I was.\\nLAUNCELOT: Yes you were.  You were in terrible peril.\\nGALAHAD: Look, let me go back in there and face the peril.\\nLAUNCELOT: No, it\\'s too perilous.\\nGALAHAD: Look, it\\'s my duty as a knight to sample as much peril as I can.\\nLAUNCELOT: No, we\\'ve got to find the Holy Grail.  Come on!\\nGALAHAD: Oh, let me have just a little bit of peril?\\nLAUNCELOT: No.  It\\'s unhealthy.\\nGALAHAD: I bet you\\'re gay.\\nLAUNCELOT: No I\\'m not\\nNARRATOR: Sir Launcelot had saved Sir Galahad from almost certain temptation, but they were still no nearer the Grail.  Meanwhile, King Arthur and Sir Bedevere, not more than a swallow\\'s flight away, had discovered something.  Oh, that\\'s an unladen swallow\\'s flight, obviously.  I mean, they were more than two laden swallows\\' flights away-- four, really, if they had a coconut on a line between them.  I mean, if the birds were walking and dragging--\\nCROWD: Get on with it!\\nNARRATOR: Oh, anyway.  On to scene twenty-four, which is a smashing scene with some lovely acting, in which Arthur discovers a vital clue, and in which there aren\\'t any swallows, although I think you can hear a starling-- oooh\\nSCENE 12:\\nOLD MAN: Heh, hee ha ha hee hee!

All that you can see, stretched out over the hills and valleys of this land!  This\\'ll be your kingdom, lad.\\nHERBERT: But Mother--\\nFATHER: Father, lad.  Father.\\nHERBERT: B-- b-- but Father, I don\\'t want any of that.\\nFATHER: Listen, lad.  I built this kingdom up from nothing.  When I started here, all there was was swamp.  Other kings said I was daft to build a castle on a swamp, but I built it all the same, just to show \\'em.  It sank into the swamp.  So, I built a second one.  That sank into the swamp.  So I built a third one.  That burned down, fell over, then sank into the swamp.  But the fourth one...  stayed up!  And that\\'s what you\\'re gonna get, lad: the strongest castle in these islands.\\nHERBERT: But I don\\'t want any of that.  I\\'d rather--\\nFATHER: Rather what?!\\nHERBERT: I\\'d rather... [music] ... just...  sing!\\nFATHER: Stop that!  Stop that!  You\\'re not going into a song while I\\'m here.  Now listen, lad.  In twenty minutes you\\'re getting married to a girl whose father owns the biggest tracts of open land in Britain.\\nHERBERT: B-- but I don\\'t want land.\\nFATHER: Listen, Alice,--\\nHERBERT: Herbert.\\nFATHER: \\'Erbert.  We live in a bloody swamp.  We need all the land we can get.\\nHERBERT: But-- but I don\\'t like her.\\nFATHER: Don\\'t like her?!  What\\'s wrong with her?!  She\\'s beautiful.  She\\'s rich.  She\\'s got huge...  tracts o\\' land.\\nHERBERT: I know, but I want the-- the girl that I marry to have...  [music] ... a certain...  special...  something!\\nFATHER: Cut that out!  Cut that out!  Look, you\\'re marrying Princess Lucky, so you\\'d better get used to the idea! [smack] Guards!  Make sure the Prince doesn\\'t leave this room until I come and get him.\\nGUARD #1: Not to leave the room even if you come and get him.\\nGUARD #2: Hic!\\nFATHER: No, no.  Until I come and get him.\\nGUARD #1: Until you come and get him, we\\'re not to enter the room.\\nFATHER: No, no.  No.  You stay in the room and make sure he doesn\\'t leave.\\nGUARD #1: And you\\'ll come and get him.\\nGUARD #2: Hic!\\nFATHER: Right.\\nGUARD #1: We don\\'t need to do anything, apart from just stop him entering the room.\\nFATHER: No, no.

Just keep him in here--\\nGUARD #1: Until you, or anyone else--\\nFATHER: No, not anyone else.  Just me.\\nGUARD #1: Just you.\\nGUARD #2: Hic!\\nFATHER: Get back.\\nGUARD #1: Get back.\\nFATHER: All right?\\nGUARD #1: Right.

Oh, yes.  Sorry.\\nFATHER: They cost fifty pounds each!\\nLAUNCELOT: Well, I\\'m awfully sorry.  Um, I really can explain everything.\\nHERBERT: Don\\'t be afraid of him, Sir Launcelot.  I\\'ve got a rope all ready.\\nFATHER: You killed eight wedding guests in all!\\nLAUNCELOT: Well, uh, you see, the thing is, I thought your son was a lady.\\nFATHER: I can understand that.\\nHERBERT: Hurry, Sir Launcelot!  Hurry!\\nFATHER: Shut up!  You only killed the bride\\'s father, that\\'s all!\\nLAUNCELOT: Well, I really didn\\'t mean to...\\nFATHER: Didn\\'t mean to?!  You put your sword right through his head!\\nLAUNCELOT: Oh, dear.  Is he all right?\\nFATHER: You even kicked the bride in the chest!  This is going to cost me a fortune!\\nLAUNCELOT: Well, I can explain.  I was in the forest, um, riding north from Camelot, when I got this note, you see--\\nFATHER: Camelot?  Are you from, uh, Camelot?\\nHERBERT: Hurry, Sir Launcelot!\\nLAUNCELOT: Uh, I am a Knight of King Arthur, sir.\\nFATHER: Very nice castle, Camelot.

Please!  This is supposed to be a happy occasion!  Let\\'s not bicker and argue about who killed who.  We are here today to witness the union of two young people in the joyful bond of the holy wedlock.  Unfortunately, one of them, my son Herbert, has just fallen to his death.\\nGUESTS: Oh!  Oh no!\\nFATHER: But I don\\'t want to think I\\'ve not lost a son, so much as...  gained a daughter! [clap clap clap] For, since the tragic death of her father--\\nGUEST #2: He\\'s not quite dead!\\nFATHER: Since the near fatal wounding of her father--\\nGUEST #2: He\\'s getting better!\\nFATHER: For, since her own father, who, when he seemed about to recover, suddenly felt the icy hand of death upon him.\\nBRIDE\\'S FATHER: Uugh!\\nGUEST #2: Oh, he\\'s died!\\nFATHER: And I want his only daughter to look upon me as her old dad, in a very real, and legally binding sense.

The dead Prince!\\nGUESTS: Oooh!

Oh...\\nTIM: To the north there lies a cave-- the cave of Caerbannog-- wherein, carved in mystic runes upon the very living rock, the last words of Olfin Bedwere of Rheged... [boom] ... make plain the last resting place of the most Holy Grail.\\nARTHUR: Where could we find this cave, O Tim?\\nTIM: Follow.  But!  Follow only if ye be men of valor, for the entrance to this cave is guarded by a creature so foul, so cruel that no man yet has fought with it and lived!  Bones of full fifty men lie strewn about its lair.  So, brave knights, if you do doubt your courage or your strength, come no further, for death awaits you all with nasty, big, pointy teeth.\\nARTHUR: What an eccentric performance\\nSCENE 21: [clop clop clop] [whinny whinny] \\nGALAHAD: They\\'re nervous, sire.\\nARTHUR: Then we\\'d best leave them here and carry on on foot.

That rabbit\\'s dynamite.\\nROBIN: Would it help to confuse it if we run away more?\\nARTHUR: Oh, shut up and go and change your armor.\\nGALAHAD: Let us taunt it!  It may become so cross that it will make a mistake.\\nARTHUR: Like what?\\nGALAHAD: Well...  ooh.\\nLAUNCELOT: Have we got bows?\\nARTHUR: No.\\nLAUNCELOT: We have the Holy Hand Grenade.\\nARTHUR: Yes, of course!

Then, shalt thou count to three, no more, no less.  Three shalt be the number thou shalt count, and the number of the counting shall be three.  Four shalt thou not count, nor either count thou two, excepting that thou then proceed to three.  Five is right out.  Once the number three, being the third number, be reached, then lobbest thou thy Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch towards thy foe, who, being naughty in my sight, shall snuff it.\\'\\nMAYNARD: Amen.\\nKNIGHTS: Amen.\\nARTHUR: Right!

Joseph of Arimathea!\\nLAUNCELOT: \\'Course!\\nARTHUR: What does it say?\\nMAYNARD: It reads, \\'Here may be found the last words of Joseph of Arimathea.  He who is valiant and pure of spirit may find the Holy Grail in the Castle of uuggggggh\\'.\\nARTHUR: What?\\nMAYNARD: \\'...  the Castle of uuggggggh\\'.\\nBEDEVERE: What is that?\\nMAYNARD: He must have died while carving it.\\nLAUNCELOT: Oh, come on!\\nMAYNARD: Well, that\\'s what it says.\\nARTHUR: Look, if he was dying, he wouldn\\'t bother to carve \\'aaggggh\\'.  He\\'d just say it!\\nMAYNARD: Well, that\\'s what\\'s carved in the rock!\\nGALAHAD: Perhaps he was dictating.\\nARTHUR: Oh, shut up.  Well, does it say anything else?\\nMAYNARD: No.  Just, \\'uuggggggh\\'.\\nLAUNCELOT: Aauuggghhh.\\nARTHUR: Aaauggh.\\nBEDEVERE: Do you suppose he meant the Camaaaaaargue?\\nGALAHAD: Where\\'s that?\\nBEDEVERE: France, I think.\\nLAUNCELOT: Isn\\'t there a Saint Aauuuves in Cornwall?\\nARTHUR: No, that\\'s Saint Ives.\\nLAUNCELOT: Oh, yes.

You the nigga with the GED.\\n\\nHipster girl: I still don\\'t understand why they say \"word.\"\\nHipster guy: Well, I think it\\'s because they don\\'t know what word to use.

Rigor mortis.\\n\\nMom: Excuse me, Mr. Chocolate Chocolate Chip Muffin, that\\'s a little revisionist, don\\'t you think?\\n\\nMailwoman: Give me some of the cheese. No, not that, the American...the Americano...the yellow stuff. I don\\'t worry about no gym so you can put more than that on. You\\'re skinny, I\\'m fat.

Shit, she has nice tits.\\n\\nTeen boy: Yo, Zach, I thought of a new Michael J. Fox joke. So, you go into a Verizon and start shaking and they go, \"Who do you think you are? Superman?\" and you say, \"No\", \\'cause you\\'re Michael J. Fox...\\'cause he has Parkinson\\'s.\\nPretty boy: All right! Fine! So I gave you herpes! Now we have herpes!\\nOld man: Tobacco kills.

It looks like she poured herself into her pantyhose.\\nStore guy: I have been a bartender and a waiter but I have never been the host. There is no way to estimate how long it will take to fit someone\\'s breast into a bra. This is an art, not a science, people!\\nSecurity guy: I\\'m surprise I haven\\'t seen nobody wearing shorts.\\nWoman: You know, there is something to be said for dressing seasonally. Seasonably? Whatever. I mean, it\\'s cool if you want to wear a tube top to the bar or whatever, but when girls are going out in these little tube tops, wear a jacket! You know? No outfit is cool unless you\\'re comfortable in it. To a degree.\\nCrazy guy: I\\'m poor! I\\'m poor! I\\'m poor! I\\'m poor! Won\\'t somebody please buy me a pair of dungarees?

You were never a fuck machine, and I certainly did know how to fake it.\\n\\nDude: Yo, I\\'m tired of this shit. I ain\\'t fuckin\\' no girl behind no nigga\\'s back....at least not that I know of.\\nGuy: But you were disappointed that you didn\\'t get molested. Admit it...Oh my god, that was a joke!

More people should know that.\\nHobo: If you see a suspicious black package on this train do not pick it up . If you see a large, black package on my seat after I leave, do worry. It is not a bomb . I\\'ve been riding this train for fifteen years. Leave it for the Coney island clean-up crew. They\\'ll take care of it.

Because they\\'re the only ones who have enough time to read the entire New York Times . Mommy will never give them a dime! They\\'re lucky I didn\\'t sue!\\nGirl: Not really, all they want to do is stay in my apartment and order delivery. They\\'re from the suburbs and don\\'t have delivery there.\\nChick: I thought this was the ghetto, but I haven\\'t seen, like, a single black person.\\nMom: Honey, this train station is very crowded. That is why they call it Grand Central Station.\\nTourist chick: Oh, so this is where it to be.\\nChick: wow, the down escalator is so much easier than the up one.\\nCrazy guy: Shit, I like the Natural History Museum. But I\\'d like it better if there were whores all around it.\\nGirl: I couldn\\'t ever take the train into work and have to deal with all the people. The trains are dirty, crowded, and takes a long time to get anywhere. That\\'s the beauty of living in New York; you don\\'t have to deal with those things.\\nGuy: So I was down on Canal, buying some of that perfume my wife likes for Valentine\\'s.

That could actually explain some things about him, you know, not getting enough attention as a child. Maybe if he had been one of three instead, we wouldn\\'t have so many problems, ha, ha, ha!...Please don\\'t repeat this to anyone.\\nDude: For real, dog, all I\\'m saying is that, she want to be with me, she gots to get rid of them kids.

Simple and coarse at the finish. **\\nThin and completely uninspiring. *\\nRough. No Stars\\nBig, fat, textured Chardonnay - nuts and butterscotch. A slightly odd metallic/cardboard finish, but probably ***\\nA blind tasting, other than the fizz, which included five vintages of Cote Rotie Brune et Blonde from Guigal.\\nSurprisingly young feeling and drinking well, but without any great complexity. A good ***\\nCharming, violet-fragranced nose. Classic Guigal Cote Rotie. ****\\nGood grip and a touch of rusticity on the length. VA showing through. On the downhill slope. Just ****\\nJust about holding together - drying out a touch at the finish. Not as good as I thought this would be.  A good ***\\nIn your face wine - rather obvious and simple (although some structure did begin to show through). ***\\nSome volatility, and all over the place on the nose and palate. It did come together more with time. ***\\nGummy nose, merlot-style sweetness. Good wine, but not in a style I was expecting. ****\\nHot on the palate, but good balance with some maturity. ***\\nThis has a Rhonish air to it, feels quite young, but it is also a bit simple. ***\\nLiquorice. Fruit beginning to dry out. **\\nGood sweetly fragranced wine. Drink now. Top ***\\nA big nose of public swimming pools - bizarre (some might say funky). *\\n\\nVery vinous - Burgundy with bubbles, to some extent and so a bit much in some ways.  I suspect it needs time to mellow - it will be interesting to see how this develops (this bottle was disgorged only last year).   If all goes well ***(*)\\nAll quite refined and delicate, appley pinot fruit, autolytic flavours. Another fairly recent disgorgement after 4 years in cellars (credit the producer for an excellent back label), it just seems a bit lacking in intensity despite the obvious quality. Perhaps this will develop but for now a good ***\\nGood fruit - nice acidity. Pretty intense although it seems quite evolved for a young wine - I fear it may go down the Ozzy route of rather early flabby kerosene flavours.  Top  **\\nCuriously Sauvignon-like - quite rich. Odd balance - people were saying this is a vineyard Huet took on and then abandoned. Good wine but it doesn\\'t seem to have the class of their major wines. A low **(*)\\nPretty nice.   Clean, rich, yet decently taught.  A credit to the appelation. Bare ***\\nA weak cork and a rather oxidised bottle - one sips for a while but then abandons it. I have had much better. Not Rated\\nVery light and delicate - decent but a bit attenuated. I have had better bottles.  ***\\nDry, savoury, quite succulent. Pleasantly high-toned, nervy, and a bit awkward.  A wine with a sense of place and hence enjoyable. ***\\nCuriously quiet, but concentration and fruit quality are all there.  Maybe just in a dull phase - perhaps it would have shown better decanted and allowed a little air.  ***\\nLeafy, dry, decent balance. Good wine but I doubt it\\'s going anywhere much.  Pleasant, and perhaps it would reward further attention.  **\\nQuite baked, decent concentration - slightly hot finish. I recall having had better from this producer.  **\\nRefined, smooth sweet (to a controlled extent) - very drinkable. Forward fruit but with the balance to hold it - the best of the New World reds, to my palate. Top ***\\nHuge monster - alcohol gets up my a nose and in my throat rather.   I find this a bit much. Returning to it later it seemed to have mellowed quite a bit  and to be a substantial wine in its way, although I find it hard to decide about it. Many will admire this, and I may too given time to consider it - I had it eight and a half years ago and was impressed.  I think I\\'ll reserve judgement for now. Not Rated\\nA bit anonymous in some ways, but very nicely poised fairly concentrated dessert wine - from the South of France somewhere, I guess. I suspect this would repay more attention and on that basis ***\\nBeautifully refined.  Complex, elegant, long with the amazing precision so typical of the producer. Lovely.   ****\\nEccentric - very rancio - complex and interesting - I need more time with this but for now  ***\\n\\nRaspingly dry, mineral, appley, severe, touch of honey developing, long.  ***(*)\\nVery fresh, lifted, aromatic. Top *\\nDry, clean, unassuming. Touch of spritz. *\\nFruity, peachy. Dry again. More richness. Nice sense of place. I could even think of ***\\nQuite mouthfilling - dry, fruity. Nice.  **\\nSoft, cigar cassis fruit - sweet finish. Pleasant. Nice condition. ***\\nSoft blackcurrant fruit - with tannic background that starts to show in the midpalate. Odd balance. **\\nA bit stinky at first - resolves - tar roses but the common old Barolo oxidativeness.  Tarry - quite hard work. Actually probably good. Top ***\\nRich again - gamy animal dry - could do with long decanting.  Bare ****\\nDark orange. Very barley-sugar - nice balance - appetizing finish. ***\\nSlightly lighter, fruitier.  Slightly oily textured. Bare ***\\nA bit faded, pleasant, lightweight. Bare ***\\n\\nCharming tempranillo sweet strawberry nose. Good balance and elegant. A good ***\\nModern stuff, rather lacking depth and complexity. **\\nAt peak or just over. Rather like a decent Cotes-du-Rhone, with a rustic edge. ***\\nPretty awful - very soft and commercial.

Again a respectable No Stars\\nEach done as a vertical - single blind\\nA slightly embarrassing start to the evening with people thinking this was vintage (1990 or 1996), possibly Krug, possibly Billecart. Lovely wine whatever. A touch of pink on the colour - a blush to cover our blushes. Elegant, good length and fine balanced acidity. A really good, cheap (under 15) fizz. ****\\nMature with Grenache cherry showing through. Charming nose. Slightly simple on the palate. A good ***\\nSlightly flat liquorice nose. More depth than the 98. Closed up and allowing the alcohol to  show through, but I think this will come together well. ***(*)\\nA touch gummy and with a hint of leather. Drier than many. Robust. ****\\nYouthful (obviously the youngest wine of this flight). Powerful wine with lovely softy tannins at the end. **(**)\\nPast its peak, although still very drinkable.

Pleasant food or quaffing wine.***\\nThe usual Penfold\\'s style - well made, and with a touch of volatility helping with the balance. ***\\n\\nDry, clean, nice piney (is that allowed?)  spicy perhaps is better. Reasonable complexity once it has warmed up above the icy temperature at which it was served. Decent length.

Decent *\\nStill a bit soft for my palate - has Mt E always been this easy?  Certainly the best of the three. Bare ***\\nAlmost Madeira-like.   It suffered a bit on serving - it was rather sedimenty. Pleasant but fading a bit. **\\nAlmost dry - nice, but no better than  it should be given the reputation of the vintage.  ***\\n\\nVery classic cedary, mature Claret nose.  Classic on the palate too, but there is an air of living dangerously, of corruption, and a general hint that the wine will crack up.  Really needs food now and probably should be drunk in the next year or two.  ***\\nClassic again on the nose, but a rather fresher, more stable palate with complex multi-faceted fruit.   Once open for an hour or so it becomes fragrant and high-toned.  Drinking well and no hurry to consume.  ****\\nThis was one of three Chapel Down wines (and a few refreshing and pleasing bottled beers) supplied by the winery.\\nI don\\'t get to try an awful lot of Bacchus nowadays, although way back I used to attend the English Wine Fair and try samples there. I can\\'t say I miss it much. This wine is floral, grapefruity and with hints of sauvignon-like flavours. Strangely for a cleanly made 11% white wine, it isn\\'t the sort of stuff you want to drink a whole bottle of - it\\'s not unpleasant, just that the acidity and fruit somehow manage to dull the tastebuds. Hopefully the Champagne style Pinot that was also sent will be more interesting. *\\nDoes wine travel well? This Champagne seems to have. Packing the car recently, I opened up one of the underfoot storage compartments to pack a bottle of fizz when I found - to my surprise - a bottle already in there. This, I worked out, had been in the car for the last couple of months (going everywhere the car went - a thousand miles or so - in the cold and in the warm). Unfortunately I didn\\'t have another, untravelled bottle of this around for comparsion.\\nLovely fizz, with good nutty steely age on the palate. Fine depth of flavour, although the palate does tire very slightly at the end. Really on very good form. ****\\n\\nGood fruit and depth of colour. Very obvious new oak on the palate. Good drinkable modern wine. ***\\n\\nFragrant, dry palate, quite meaty and serious.  Time to drink I guess - it will never be soft and the fruit is fully mature.  Rather enjoyable. ***\\nI don\\'t often drink village Chablis. This is a good example of what you get from a good one: all the stony minerality and dryness of a premier cru but just a bit less intense and refined.   Best with food. **\\nSeems a bit thin and mean straight from cellar, but when it warms up its fantastic: dry and succulent but with intense strawberry fruit and a bit of beetroot in the mouth.   Quite structured - it will probably improve a bit yet. Am I being overgenerous with ***(*)\\nQuite tight and lean,   I wondered a bit whether it wasn\\'t a little thin when judged by the highest standards, but while not an absolute star, more and more emerged with some breathing.   Very well-defined hazelnut fruit and taut acidity.  Excellent wine with no sign of the problems that plague some wines in this vintage.  Top ***\\nLovely bright, crisp red fruits.  Excellent concentration and balance, great fruit but bone dry.  Just a lovely village wine, I thought at first - but after some time to breath it seemed to have complexity and interest beyond that.  Top ***\\nTop, top quality. Creamy fruit,  lean, complex and mineral - with only a slightly reduced intensity and length reflecting the modest vintage. ****\\nVery good village wine - good fruit and the fine acidity of the vintage. Delicious. A good ***\\nQuite rich, forward, exotic fruit.   Drinking nicely.  This bottle had been forgotten in a freezer overnight, and then thawed - didn\\'t seem to have done much damage, and as my host remarked it\\'s an easy way of opening the bottle. **\\nPure, quite mineral,  the fact that this is a \"no new oak\" wine very pleasingly evident.  Quite a lot of richness to the fruit too, specially once it had been open for half an hour.   Could probably do with a couple of years and might age well for longer.   Nice wine.  Bare ***\\n\\nUnderstated, quite complex, but a little flat and dominated by a caramel/toffee overlay that I\\'m not keen on.   Being a Tempier fan I was expecting a lot from this, but on this showing I\\'m not wildly keen. **\\nDull, very deep-coloured and tending to oxidation.  Nothing like a couple of other halves of this from the same lot which were lovely.  An early case of \"poxy white Burgundy\" or just a dodgy cork? Not Rated\\nAttractive and drinkable, but lacking the mineral complexity of the Launois NV drunk recently. ***\\nPleasant mature rieslong - needing drinking fairly soon. Bare ***\\nWriting up my notes from visiting D-J in Rully persuaded me to open this, brought back from their cellars.\\nBright, attractive and authentic, but lacking any special buzz.  I wrote that on initially drinking a glass or two: returning the following night this has opened out and is showing lovely minerality.

A very easy ****\\n\\nDeep colour, very yeasty nose and honied appley fruit with bags of mushrooms. Evolved. Quite bold and rich.

Very fine.  ***(*)\\nMineral, nice fruit, dry and taught.  Starting to drink nicely.  Bare ****\\nDeep colour, rather lovely, gentle, long, mellow, nutty and delightful.

Still improving but may be won\\'t merit another star.  Pretty good.  ***\\nDusty, quite large but dry. Tending towards baked (typical of the vintage) - a little chunky. Still pretty good. Quite a Clarety style of Burgundy. Bare ***(*)\\nClosed at first, but opens out - lovely pure raspberry fruit. High-toned. Very long. Needs a few more years to peak.  ****(*)\\nDry, nice, savoury,  but time to drink.  Top ***\\nColour tending to brown.  Quite animal,  rich and decadent - fades a bit in the glass and rapidly becomes cloying. **\\nAmazing dense young colour. Floral, mineral, tobacco. Iodine finish.  Very fine indeed.  *****\\nMineral nose, rich cherry fruit hot iron finish.  Fantastic interest - packed with ripe tannins. Great balance - but lots of potential. Top ****(*)\\nVery easy, silky, forward. Touch of class.  I would like to try this from a stronger vintage and with a bit of age. ***\\nApricot fruit, creamy texture and flavour. No great complexity (typical  of Eiswein).  Lovely acidity. Bare ****\\nAs it opens up, rather fine - raspberry fruit, touch of chocolate, a bit spirity towards the end.  Moderate weight now. Top ****\\nVery fresh, lots of fizz. Touch of yeast, etc - a touch shorter and less weighty than the Bolly.  In spectacularly good condition and with fine, precise bready flavours. Lovely Top ****\\n\\nFrom a half. Its usual reliable self - fine bubbles and good medium-weight balance. ***\\nFrom a half. Simple and charming. I love claret like this, especially when the purpose of the evening is purely social rather than wine related. This is at peak and a pleasure to drink. ***\\nOK stuff with decent fruit. A touch coarse. **\\nBeautiful. Especially after a bottle of indifferent Prosecco drunk with candied(?) hibiscus flowers in the glass. The Lynch-Bages is elegant, and suggests an inner depth that is not at present fully forthcoming. Hints of peach kernel and tempered steel. ****\\nPoor alongside the Lynch-Bages. Too soft and undemanding. ***\\nThis needs a bit more time. Good structure and supple tannins - medium length. A good ***\\n\\nBrought round by a friend for a Sunday lunch. A slight whiff of the farmyard when first opened, but this cleared to reveal a light-to-medium weight claret with classic cigar box. ***\\n\\nRich vanilla fruit, excellent concentration.  Not the last word in elegance and the mousse is a bit coarse - but overall a splendid wine.  At least a good ***(*)\\nFruitcakey Claret, quite big and robust - seems a little woody at first but returning a day later it\\'s clean, nicely-toned mature wine.   Chunky and in the final analysis not that complex, but good. ***\\n\\nVanillan, lovely mousse,  very elegant.  Understated class. ****\\nRich, good riesling character, quite a lot of residual sugar.  Good in its way. ***\\nLovely fresh fruit.  Complex, delicate nose. Falls off a bit in the mouth.   Opens out with some air and holds up well on returning after the other wines.  This is one of their lesser wines - it\\'s a credit to the property. ***\\nRich, lively, smoky, very nice. Less fine than the Cubillo but richer.  (From a half.) ***\\nInky, tannic, plummy, a bit baked. Lovely secondary characters merging.  ***(**)\\nSuaver, rounder, suggestive of Pomerol.  Pure and a touch  higher-toned than the Barton.  Not ready but a bit shorter-term too. Top ***(*)\\nTerribly refined, mature Claret. Great breed and balance.  I sometimes find Pichon just a little too suave and lacking edge for my tastes, but this is a super wine. ****\\nNice old nose. A touch of tea - good but doesn\\'t develop on the palate. Creamy vanilla.  Just a bit rubbery but that becomes less noticeable as it opens in the glass. ***\\nGamy,mineral yet edgy and unbalanced.  Interesting yet also slightly flawed. Possibly a dodgy bottle.  Top  ***\\nRich, limey fruit.  Young-seeming. Apple finish. Excellent - marred ever so slightly by a raw woody background.  Top ***\\nA touch pruney and hard - opens up a bit but remains  a bit unsatifyingly remote.   I would expect more.   ***\\nFresh, fragrant raspberry nose. Fine, elegany, light palate. Joyfully lovely. *****\\n\\nElegant as always, silky-testured drinking wine.  but I don\\'t feel this has the power for long-term evolution that (say) the 1990 has.  Drinking nicely now. Top ***\\nDrinking (from a half) really beautifully now.  A delight. ****\\nI recall being a bit disappointed last time I drank one of these magnums.   This one however is delightful, mature, berryish St Emilion.   Breed and balance to the fore.  Very good drinking. Top ***\\n\\nInitially modern, rich, almost flashy.  Later, gamy.  Not sure what to make of this - it\\'s not like the Vallana wines of old but it is quite substantial. Top  **\\nPure, luscious. Not really a keeper on this showing.   Top ***\\nFunky, showing age, substantial but odd. ***\\nNicely integrated, a touch sweet and easy perhaps but high quality. Top ***\\n\\nFragrant nose with a tar underlay.  High-toned, pure yet quite gutsy tannins too.  Persistent on the finish with chocolatey notes.  It\\'s pretty tightly wound still and a bit enigmatic.  My guess is a bare ***(*)\\n\\nClean, dry, attractive. Very drinkable. **\\n\\nVery pure, high-toned yet silky fruit.  Somewhat in the Burgundian style but with roses, tar and chocolate and noticable but ripe Nebbiolo tannins.   On the other hand it has that floral scentedness of proper old-fashioned Bordeaux.  Doubtless worth keeping a few years but it is so well-made it is a pleasure to drink now. Top ***\\n\\nPerhaps starting to tire a bit nice fruit, quite dry-seeming now with a bit of Pfalzy weight and a hint of hardness.  Pleasant enough. **\\n\\nYeasty, quite meaty. Rich. Needs a few years.  I haven\\'t had a recently purchased bottle of Pol for a while and was surprised by its weight. Good though. ***\\nLovely sous-bois and blackberry  nose,  silky fruit, ripe (in the modern style) with succulent, tannins.   Rather classy in a fairly modern way. (A quick thrash onGoogle reveals this one some sort of IWC trophy - I can understand that.)  Not entirely my sort of thing but still perhaps worth a bare ***(*)\\nIodine and iron, rich, decadent, fleshy.  Fruitcake fruit.   Good, and time to drink. Bare ****\\n\\nTight acidity, fine and intense.  I\\'ve been a bit up-and-down about this wine but I\\'m sure I like this bottle. Perhaps even ****\\nQuite big, a touch flabby, rather evolved and vegetal. I\\'m not sure what combination of producer, vintage and possibly premature oxidation accounts for this, being unfamiliar with the first two factors in this case.   Still pretty drinkable.  Bare ***\\nLightweight, feminine and fragrant although with quite a hard core running through it that suggests drinking with food.  Modest acidity, and so I am not sure how long this is for keeping.  Very pleasant but without real distinction at the highest level. Top ***\\nNot very striking.  **\\nHerby nose, quite tight and nicely balanced for the vintage. ***\\nJuicy, succulent, a touch of minerality.  Very good: drinking but will probably improve a bit yet.  ***\\nAn attractive combionation of piquant high-toned fruit with a lovely rounded ripeness.  Very good - for drinking over the next few years, I think. Top ***\\n(Domaine de la Bon Gran) Rather rich, touch of botrytis probably, pretty good. ***\\nReally nice - quite forward as the producers wines tend to be, quite big but in balance.   No hint of the problems of the vintage.  Top ***\\nThe second bottle of H. Lignier 1er cru from this vintage I have tried recently.  This is so pure, digestible and generally fine, but understated - it doesn\\'t shout and it doesn\\'t have a particular note of individuality for me.   Yet it is a complete wine that I like a lot.   Beginning to drink well, but not a long-haul wine.   Top ***\\n\\nNotably off-dry still, very fresh with rounded, attractive fruit. Good. ***\\nLovely apple and cream nose, slightly honied and a touch of yeast.  Fine mousse too. Lovely.  A 93/94/95 blend I believe.   Top ****\\nThat old Rioja nose of nuts and mushrooms and something slightly medical - lovely. Very fresh, nicely rounded fruit.  Ultimately I suppose not complex enough to be a great wine but rather good. Bare ****\\nGood intensity, the fruit has a distinct character: mineral, not fruit-driven, something almost secondary about what is surely primary fruit.  Very engaging.  Top ***\\nVery gentle, completely resolved, pleasantly enjoyable. ***\\nAll very lovely, but despite the deftness of the touch of new barriques, I feel it lacks the crystaline purity of his other wines. ***\\nAn enigma: that slightly \"flat\" souuthern-French palate, but with air an engaging herby nose. Is it going anywhere?  I\\'m not sure. Top **\\nLovely cherry fruit. Very attractive. ***\\nGood Syrah character, fruit-driven but not to the point of undrinkability.  Pleasant. Scrapes **\\nSubstantial and weighty, notable botrytis, interesting palate but perhaps tending towards rustic.  This was just a taste -I\\'d be interested to try more. ***\\nFruit still has a lot of primary blackcurrant but the structure seems resolved so I guess this is for drinking now.  Creamy, some cigar-box, all in all attractive fruit, but a little too undemanding to rate a really high score. Top ***\\nI guess I could get used to this trocken business:  this has good fruit and is bone-dry without being harsh.  Still fairly moderate alcohol at 12%, the overall balance is good.  A year or two short of its peak, I suspect. ***\\nBlackberry fruit, some oak I think - quite tannic perhaps from the oak. Modern-style. **\\nAn interesting expression of the Langhe, if with a modern tinge of new oak. Everything Conterno makes iselegan and drinkable and this is no exception. On the other hand I can\\'t feel it is ultimately distinguished in the way that his Barolos are.  A mix of four grape varietoes including Nebbiolo. Bare ***\\nRound berry fruit, quite a lot of blackcurrant, some tobacco.   Very nice mature Claret, if tending slightly towards the rustic - lacks the fineness of a top wine. Good though. ***\\nQuite spritzy initially but the next day that had dissipated and the honeysuckle Soave charcter and pure fruit very evident.  Good length too. Top **(*)\\nThis is better every time I try it - class will out and I think it is Le Mesnil fruit that is giving it such minerality and complexity. Delicious. ****\\nMy last bottle of this.  It\\'s really a relaxed, fully mature, attractive and balanced wine.  Enough complexity to be interesting and the primary fruit that I remember being rather excessive years ago is now nicely in balance.  Very good.  I notice in passing that it is a relativel modest 12.5% alcohol. ***\\nVery classy, pure, blackberry and apple fruit.   Demanding but ripe tannins, very succulent.   Really good Dolcetto. ***\\nSpritzy from dissolved CO2 I guess.  Excellent richness of fruit, intensity and length.   Nice sweetness balanced by really good acidity. At least ***(*)\\nLovely bright appetising Mosel wine, yet with a rich fruitiness. Very attractive. Top ***\\nThe second time I\\'ve tried this recently.  It\\'s an Ozzie-like Cabernet Syrah blend but with a very unozzie dry palate.   Seems to get better the longer it is open. Fine wine. ***\\nA dry dark Oloroso-like palate - what a P.C. ought to have I guess but I often find them more Amontillado there too as well as on the nose.  Rather good.  15 years old according to their web site.   Top ***\\n\\nSpicy riesling petrolly nose. Pretty dry - good length.  But fairly simple and light.   *\\nAgain petrolly - rather richer.   Quite good concentration. Dry.  I wonder how this will go given it is already so petrolly.  **\\nHoney and caramel. Butter.  Less intense on the palate. Good **\\nLess ambitious and benefits from that - in fact reasonably concentrated and intense. ***\\nUnusually intense vanilla nose. Damp straw - quite heavy-textured.  **\\nHonied and rich. Charred nose and oily fruit.  Big and long.  Impressive in its way (which is not my way). Bare ***\\nBerry nose.  Oddly rasping finish. **\\nMinty.  Similar - finishes a bit abruptly.  **\\nMinty.   A bit toffeed. High-toned. I\\'m not wild about this.   **\\nLiquor blackberries. Medium-weight palate - oddly bitter finish. Might be going to be rather good. (I keep getting this wine in situations where I can\\'t sit back,drink a couple of glasses and think about it.  I must try and do that at some point.) ***\\nDry, pure, well-made. Balanced. ***\\nLiquour raspberry again.  A bit thick. Softer and lacking the attack of the 2001. **\\nHints at mint again.  Oddly twisty. Yet more balanced than the Chileans. **\\nQuite fresh, fruity, straw-like. High-toned. Rather nice.  ***\\nPleasant and gracefully old - perhaps going a bit flat.  Top **\\nI spent the day moving paving slabs (heavy and intense) and making fish stock (light and intense). The stock was poured over some cod, sea bass, spinach and creme fraiche (this isn\\'t Fine Wine Dairy, but it does pay to get decent creme fraiche) and then baked in the oven with a little grated parmesan. Stroganoff, excellent cheeses from the Cambridge Cheese Company and a passion fruit tart from Maison Blanc in Oxford (that my daughter was very passionate about) followed.\\nGood fizz which is perhaps just beginning to tire. Medium weight and with a hint of oxidation. Top ***\\nRather simple after the de Venoge - lighter weight. Some complexity emerges after a while in the glass. ***\\nThis was the sort of bottle you would avoid even on the most generous of bin-end offers: the label stained and some evidence that the wine was seeping through the cork and dribbling down the capsule. However, the wine inside was lovely. This was as tight a Riesling as you could hope to taste with classic minerality and finely tuned acidity. A really fine effort with time ahead. ***(*)\\nOne of those wines where the first sniff tells you that you are in the presence of something special. Glorious sweet St Julien fruit with a palate that is on first taste deceptively simple. None of the Â\\x91typical Talbot whiff of the barnyard\\' that Broadbent notes, but rather, on this showing, a wine of great purity and lasting structure. Superb, and at a glorious peak. *****\\nFrom magnum. I guess this was always going to be a come down after the previous wine (I rather naughtily tasted them in this order when others at the table were more conventional in their drinking order). This is reliable stuff that is drinking well with its tarry, coffee and chocolate overtones. Good claret that, enjoyable though it is (I am drinking it whilst typing these notes), gets relegated, for now, to the luncheon division. A good ***\\nFrom a half. Delicious and aging rather well. Good apricoty acidity and with a sweetness that is verging on being oversweet, but which is contained within the framework of the wine. I think this will age into something truly great. ****(*)\\n\\nShowing its age with a tendency towards maderisation but very drinkable with yeasty rich fruit and good length. ****\\nLike a Viognier almost, nicely intense. Top **\\nPure black-cherry fruit in profusion. Good concentration and so on, with a slightly cassis character that seems quite common in modern wines.  How will this age I wonder? Probably quite well although the whole package is a bit soft for my taste.  Top ***\\nFragrant, lightweight (a very poor vintage of course), no very great length, needs drinking soon but it still has lovely minerality and is very stylish.  Top ***\\nMeatier, longer and generally a bit more substantial than the 93 with a slight bitterness on the finish that will probably ease further although the wine must be close to peak. Again so individual and so much a terroir wine.  I love it. Bare ****\\nBackward, dense but fragrant and long.  Coming towards peak.   Really lovely. ****(*)\\nThis has rather a baked fruit character that I am not so keen on.  It is hard to taste against great wines like the Gentaz, but only a top **\\nFragrant, dry and long.  More mineral and complex than the other Ogier wines.   Really lovely and should be drunk on its own away from the Gentaz wines that tend to upstage it. ****\\nAn absolute star that could even benefit from another year or two.  Tremendous weight, and concentrated minerality but all in balance.  Fantastic.  Top *****\\nNeeds a swirl or two in the glass but characteristic Cote Rotie violets emerge.   Very good. Top ***\\nThis has a solid core of fruit, and the minerality and complexity that all the wines possess. It is a touch harder and a touch less strong all round than the 89 however. Bare *****\\nFragrant, balanced, easy-going wine with a nice dry finish. Good ***\\nCorked. Not Rated\\nAwkwardly dry and rather short.  Would go down quite well with food perhaps but not great - hardly surprising given the vintage. Top **\\nAsian spices (as R.P. so often says).  Fresh (almost youthful still) with fantastically long fruit. Gorgeous. Top *****\\nOxidised - might be an odd bottle so I won\\'t rate it but of course at this age from this vintage they might all be this way. Not Rated\\nMore awkward than the 85 - it lacks that wines easy balance. But this is really complex and the minerality is perhaps even more pronounced. Intellectual wine and really good. *****\\nMore open and leafy, lacks the poise of the best vintages but does give a long mineral mouthful. ****\\nTop stuff but a little flabby and keroseney for a special cuvee from this producer. Top ***\\nMineral, broad, intense with a restrained, crystalline purity.  Brilliant. *****\\n\\nPale tangerine colour in a decanter.  Intensely gingery on the nose (as Ramonet\\'s wines often are) but to a grotesque degree.  Rather horrible palate - probably just oxidised but in a rather odd way.  A day later the oxidation aspect less apparent but still extravagently gingery and with a dull flatness. No Stars\\nMuch more what one expects - plenty of acid, quite juicy, nice fruit. ***\\nQuite leafy  liquid tobacco.   This seems to have gone backwards a bit since I last tasted it - clearly needs a few years but good drinking now too. ***(*)\\n\\nAccording to the front label \\'An original blend of 95% SYRAH\\'; according to the back label a \\'wonderful accompaniment to chicken dishes, goat\\'s cheese tart or full flavoured cheeses\\' and \\'Suitable for vegetarians and vegans\\'. Unlike the labelling, the wine isn\\'t too contrived. Good balance and good red fruit depth. It will probably improve with a few years age. By the way, the other 5% is Mouvedre [sic]. Just **(*)\\nI wasn\\'t expecting much of this - Sunday evening combined with a general foreboding about white Rhones. What a revelation though! Glorious full bodied stuff with a lovely toffee and honeysuckle length to the palate. A wine I could drink and drink - and not just on Sundays. ****\\n\\nGood old fizz with touches of honey, wood and aniseed. Medium bodied and with the acidity to keep the mature flavours together. ****\\nA disappointing wine in some sense. Quite winey, and doesn\\'t really have the class one expects. Relatively (for a big name from \\'96) rather simple and lacking the drama and complexity of something to tuck away for the future. Possibly an off form bottle. **(*)\\n\\nExotic, rich, old-fashioned. Splendid. ***\\nPeachy, exotic, quite evolved.   Made to drink fairly young, but has that Grand Cru something about it. Bare  ****\\nSo floral, pure and beautiful. Intense, dry.  Approachable but lots of underlying structure. Completely gorgeous. *****(*)\\nMineral, very attractive, drinking nicely.   ***\\nRounder and a bit more concentrated.  Mineral finish.  Very good.  Still fairly young. ***(*)\\nMuch more reserved.

Very classic. *****\\nThanks to everybody for bringing interesting and enjoyable wines, and to Centotre for feeding us well.\\nDry,  rich, appetising. Long. Pretty  nice.  I feel a bit of barrique aging is aiming at an international market, but it is good.   I\\'d like to sit down and drink a few glasses one evening.   Maybe even scrapes  ***\\nQuite Burgundian weight.

Top ***\\nHealthy colour - cedary, fruitcake nose and a pleasantly balanced palate. Pretty much at peak, but holding nicely - a bit of air and it opens up and reveals a fragrant side too.  I haven\\'t always been overwhelmed by the wines from this estate, but this has shifted my opinion up a bit. ***\\nVery pleasantly cedary, but this Bordeaux-style wine\\'s fruit is becoming a bit thin now.  **\\nMy last bottle of this: lemony vanilla, touch of sherry character but completely and enjoyably fresh and appetising.   Almost timeless, but I guess it wouldn\\'t improve.   Very pleasant mature wine (of an unfashionable sort). ***\\nScented, dry and savoury - old-fashioned Claret that isn\\'t that weighty. Very pleasant, but I think perhaps not one of the best wines from this property - it is still improving but may not rate more stars. ***\\nI haven\\'t tasted this for eight years, I think.   I rated it very highly then as a young wine and now it has a restrained but lovely old apricot nose and a wonderful density of fruit of fruit and a rich, extravagently viscous texture. There\\'s a nice level of acidity too that stops it cloying and a very long finish.   Very lovely, but I have slight reservations about the complexity -  it does seem, as one might perhaps expect from the grape, a touch one-dimensional given its other qualities. ****\\nMy first sampling of Jadot\\'s Beaujolais project.  My first thought was that I was expecting something a bit larger, but the fruit has good, under-stated concentration and there is an attractive mineral core too.  Very drinkable, yet there is a tannic underpinning that will give a at least a few years of positive evolution.   I am quite positive about htis - for now a conservative **(*)\\nLovely, intense, Grenache-based wine - long, balanced, like a very good Chateauneuf. Easy top ***\\nThe Lamaione is a disappointing wine. I remember having it for the fist time (before FWD, in 1995 or earlier I guess). Then it oozed class, and in 1997 I still rated it highly. But since then it has declined, and now one word will do: \\'undrinkable\\' - although I\\'ve expanded slightly beyond that below. I wonder whether its earlier showing was flattered by some flashy wine making (carb. mac.?). There aren\\'t many wines I\\'ve poured down the sink, but this was one of them.\\nHarsh and astringent. Completely gone. No Stars\\nI don\\'t want to be unfair to this wine (it was a quick replacement for the undrinkable Lamaione), but this isn\\'t quite of the standard that previous vintages of this wine used to be - although, possibly, it is just a bit closed. *\\nA really good bottle of this wine - it seems in the past to have varied between 3 and 4 stars.

There is something of Macon-with-bubbles about it but nevertheless it\\'s very drinkable. Good ***\\nSome lovely wine, but also some disappointments. I\\'ve had Talbot, Gruaud Larose and Las Cases 1982 in the last few months, and whilst the first two have been stunning; the last one is not showing well.\\nLovely together fizz - good acidity - elegant. ****\\nDelicious weighty wine with a good, heavy acidity.

Too heavily sweet for my tastes. ***\\n\\nThe last time I had this, in 2002, it seemed a weedy wine that probably wasn\\'t going to live to its youthful potential. It just had the odd glimpse suggesting it might improve - but I wasn\\'t that convinced. Fortunately though, this bottle at least is on lovely form. A dry wine without flashiness, but lovely toned acidity and flavours that are constantly developing in the glass. And to think that I almost decided to drink all my bottles in 2002.

Not quite as demanding as the Coliseo from this house but very fine. ****\\nVery drinkabe old sherry, grippy and with that nice hint of sourness.   Not the last word in fineness however - I feel this hints a bit at dry-cleaning fluid. ***\\nRich and long with rather greater depth than a standard Fino - salty tang too, nice acidity and a long, citric finish.  Very clean and pure. ***\\n\\nNot quite one thing or the other if you know what I mean. Vibrant ripe fruit to start with but with a green and dilute finish. Not as interesting as I would have hoped. **\\n\\nGood fruit but perhaps a touch rustic - old straw farmyard characters of a pleasant sort.   Completely mature and very drinkable.

Bare ***\\nSeems pretty much ready to drink - nice balance, generous fruit and a nice dry finish.   Bare ****\\nLovely appetising, drinkable wine (breaking for another mouthful as I type).   Not a hint of the varietal flab, yet lovely ripe fruit and mineral overtones. Something of almonds about the whole package too.  This has the balance to keep well for a while I feel, and it may even improve over a year or so.  Dry yet not austere, and with really good length.  Classy. ***\\n\\nClean, fresh and simple wine with lightweight raspberry fruit. **\\nA touch oxidised, but I couldn\\'t decide whether this was the winemaking or a duff bottle. So, until I get to try it again Not Rated\\n\\nFrom a magnum. Good sweet fruit, chocolate and coffee. Good balance for drinking now. Top ***\\n\\nBone dry and with good intensity and length.   It just seems to lack a bit of pizzaz - the whole effect is a touch (but just a touch)  flat. ***\\nSilky-textured and rich,  one feels this wine is part of the transition to a modern style here.  But this has produced a fine wine in this vintage, voluptuous, but still with enough stuffing. ***\\nNice mature riesling nose - completely resolved and really quite soft and lovable. Top ***\\nI have mixed feelings about this: on the plus side, fine nettle-like fruit, nicely balanced, now mature with a decent finish and a streak of minerality; on the minus side a slight lack of real presence,  just a little underwhelming considering the reputation of the producer.  Scrapes ***\\nIt\\'s easy to scoff at Musar, and until today I hadn\\'t opened one of my own bottles for a year or two, but it\\'s really not half bad you know.  Rustic, yes - ultimately fairly simple, yes - but it does have lovely round, sweet, leathery fruit and it has aged very gracefully to a soft, amber-edged maturity.  So it\\'s easy to scoff in the other sense too. ***\\nSome will say this is past its peak but I rather like it. Mature riesling apricot flavours, old wine roundedness, very pleasant. ***\\nQuite big, ripe and sweet for spatlese.  Very attractive, quite forward and engaging fruit.  Very good rather than really riveting. Top ***\\nQuite big, ripe and rich.  This has a timeless quality - while showing some mature characters it is still quite sweet and very fresh - it will benefit from more time in bottle I think and will probably merit 4 stars in the long run.  Impressive. ***(*)\\nRemeniscent of a top Rhone Grenache: high-toned, a touch medicinal.   This is really good wine - intense fruit but a nice balance. Top ***\\nThis has now opened up nicely - gorgeous long, mouthfilling greengage fruit.   It was so tight a few years ago and it has been fascinating to watch its progress.  It is bone dry and has that Wachau sternness that (slightly to my surprise) I am often a bit ambivalent about.  This though is drinking so nicely - perhaps it\\'s just a mistage to try and drink these wines young.  Very top ***\\nThis seems to have become a touch more piquant and high-toned than I recall.  A grown-up\\'s wine with tanins that might never be entirely mellow until too late, and a classic Claret nose.  Lovely.  top ***\\nSherberty, very open fruit, and very pleasantly drinkable at 8% alcohol.   A bit spritzy at first and ever so slightly hollow on the palate, if I was going to criticise. On the other hand, it has a lovely long finish.   Ready to drink I guess, but no great hurry.  Lovely. Top ***\\nRaspberry fruit, nodding at cassis also, dry, very firm as this producers wines tend to be - still a touch hard.  Very nice village wine coming round as it approaches its 10th birthday. ***\\nRather nice - intense grapefruity riesling, with something towards nectarine on a persistant finish.  Seems quite dry to me for a classic-style Rheingau but that may partly be the particularly good acidity.   Drinking nicely but no hurry to consume - might even be better in a few years.  Top ***\\nA high-toned wine from this most European-styled of Californian winemakers, with rich yet piquant fruit.  This will improve a bit I suspect but needs the right food.  Bare ***\\nSeven year-old Soave? The fruit is now rather evolved - peach kernels and almonds, but still fresh and with a hint of floral notes on the nose.  Some will say this is past its best but I like it a lot.  Dry, attractive, drinkable. A good ***\\nDry, yet with with very nicely-textured fruit.  A bargain at well the right side of a tenner. **\\nPleasant. **\\nNice example, without any great extra complexity. Top **\\n\\nRed Burgundy Wine as it helpfully says on the label. Rather dilute and lacking. Possibly just too old. *\\nSweeter fruit than the above, and with a simple charm. But hard work finding much flavour. **\\nA  bit unripe on the palate, and with coarse fruit. Some (pleasant) signs of  maturity on the nose, but not coordinated with the rest of the wine. **\\nEasily the best of the recent Pinots that I\\'ve had. A touch stewed, but at least not suffering the dilute characters of the two French wines. ***\\n\\nMedium depth, well put together for early drinking. Reasonably taut. ***\\nLiquorice and black cherry nose. Charming for early drinking. ***\\n\\nOccasional glimpses of bacon fat and raspberry, but some coarseness and awkwardness. **\\nA slight spritz on opening. Lihtly honeyed and with hints of blanched almonds. ***\\n\\nSherberty rich,  drinking very nicely as it has for a while and will for a few years yet. Long and delicious. Top ***\\nRounded, forward fruit - pleasant but  ultimately fairly simple. Bare ***\\nRather overwrought - huge alcohol - rather flabby fruit (although superficially there\\'s decent acidity). A substantial wine that perhaps I just wasn\\'t in the mood for.  Top **\\nGamy, rustic, high-quality fruit.   Interesting, quite complex, characterful.  Guessed this might be Swan. Top ***\\nGood fruit.  Nicely balanced.  Good concentration.  Good ***\\nBaked, tarry fruit.  Very tannic - serious (perhaps overly so).

Probably for drinking now, and pretty pleasant in its way.  ***\\nA bit drier and more mainstream.   Still a shade closed,  very good.  Bare ***(*)\\n\\nPossibly seems a bit older than it is. Good acidity and some tannin at the end of a fairly full bodied, old-fashioned entrance. Needs some time to resolve itself. ****(*)\\nMore floral and open than the last bottle I had of this. Well made fizz for drinking young. ***\\nFairly vinous and with good, sharply focused acidity at the end. A champagne that tastes like a good young fizzy Burgundy. This needs time, and could be stunning. ***(**)\\nPossibly not in the best of condition compared with a recent bottle that Toby had. The flavours are a bit dull and it is more oxiidative than might be expected. Not Rated\\n\\nWeighty, meaty nose - autolytic plus apples.   Similarly with the palate, but not at the expense of balance.  Apples again, a suggestion of tannins.  Long, quite complex, perhaps a touch young - I\\'m sure a year or two in cellar will be beneficial.  Scrapes ***(*)\\nReally quite forward - touch of vanilla - long and enjoyable but doesn\\'t seem to have the guts to be a real keeper.  Bare ****\\nOnly a year or two delayed versus the standard vintage. Still very fresh, nutty and autolytic - really yeasty on the nose.   Drier and tighter than the GA 97 too - lower dosage probably and perhaps the vintage too. Complex finish.  Lovely. Scrapes  *****\\nRed wine made from Pinot Noir, of course. Fairly complex nose, bone dry - seems a bit flat and old on the mid-palate. All the interest is on the nose.  Rather dull in the mouth.  If fizz could be made with these grapes, then this is a bit of a waste except that it gives some insight into the nature of fruit that makes good Champagne.   Bare **\\nVery mushroom and truffle - and hinting at maderisation.  Curious indeed,  and not entirely positively. Old beyond its years - is it an odd bottle? The guy from Bollinger says not, but seemed to have decided this before nosing mine.  Perhaps having this after desert was a poor idea (I did think of leaving my pud until later) and I wouldn\\'t be surprised if there is more to this wine than I found.  For now, the interest on the nose scrapes ****\\n\\nLovely delicate summer drinking with almond and white fruit flavours. ***\\n\\nLovely delicate summer drinking with almond and white fruit flavours. ***\\n\\nFragrant, mellow, eminently drinkable.  Fresh but a suspicion of drying at the end suggests this is not for keeping beyond another five or so years. ***\\nHigh-toned, a bit of cranberry, a touch of underlying meatiness and excellent fruit.  Lovely but without the va-va-voom of the Combe aux Moins from the same producer and vintage tasted recently.  Still scrapes ***(*)\\nLively, quite complex, proper tarry Barolo and more or less \"a point\".  A bit coarse-textured to be worth more than ***\\nThe things one finds when cataloguing the cellar - an auction purchase of a couple of bottles I seem to recall.  I opened one with trepidation but no need: actually a healthy light colour and a lovely, fresh, tar and roses Barolo nose.  The fruit had that underlying sweetness that good Barolo has and which with the fragrance sets off the firmness of even mature tannins.   Not terribly complex but really very enjoyable drinking.   ***\\nI have oscillated a bit about this 100% Gargenega wine.   It is Ca Rugate\\'s interpretation of what old Soave might have been like, I seem to recall.   It has a deep colour (from skin contact, I think) and a broad, flat, mouthfilling palate after a honeysuckle nose. It reminds me a bit of one or two other Italian producers who are pushing things in a similar direction: Massa Vecchia and Gravner.   It is rather less grand than either (and a bit cheaper)  but I like it, and I think time is making it more interesting. ***\\nIntense strawberry nose, solid, concentrated  fruit, quite dry as often with Lafarge. A touch of Italianate bitterness and quite firm tannins make it rather a food wine at the moment.   I hope that rawness wears off - I think it will.   ***(*)\\nSurprisingly high-toned almost Amontillado-like nose. Palate has warm raisiny character and a nice texture. ***\\nVery pure, raspberry fruit.  Now completely resolved and drinking very nicely. I think it lacks the real edge of terroir at this stage, or something to add complexity.   Drinking pretty nicely however. ***\\nSmoky raspberry fruit, begining to show its age a bit but still fresh.  Very drinkable but not super-exciting. ***\\nQuite fat and mouthfilling - I haven\\'t drunk this producers wines or Chablis from this vintage much so I\\'m not sure about the cause of this rather atypical richness.   Still, this has a lovely honey-influenced palate and enough underlying minerality to be very enjoyable. Absolutely at peak.  From a half.   Top ***\\nI seem to remember having mixed feelings about a bottle of this, but this one is lovely - completely drinkable medicinally-edged concentrated Grenache. Excellent. ***\\nHerbs and spices, with rounded green-pea and other vegetal flavours.  Quite individual but really, really  good. ****\\nAnother 96 from my cellar, opened partly to illuminate the controversy about this vintage.

Good at the price.  **(*)\\nLovely, vibrant,  deep pink colour.  Once open for a quarter of an hour, a delicious nose of strawberry fruit.  Quite vinous - like a substantial still rose rather than Champagne with a touch of colour.   Long finish.   Will probably benefit from a year or two in bottle.

Well made. **\\nRather good fruit, oak fairly evident on the palate but probably not excessive (although I must say I like less and less oak in my wines),  quite mineral too.

OK, 1990 isn\\'t that old, but this isn\\'t the greatest name in Champagne either. Good, slightly oxidised maturity with the 1990s softness evident. ***\\nThis bottle has been shouting \\'drink me, drink me!\\' for the last couple of years - eyeing me up each time I opened the cellar. I had it last in 1999, when it was disappointing. This time though it was a glorious claret with warm, pencil-shaving nose and palate. I\\'m glad I\\'ve resited its calling until now because this bottle was caught at its best. There is a touch of weediness (well it\\'s not the best vintage ever), but the balance is fine. This is the sort of wine that makes keeping fine wine so satisfying. I could drink a lot of this, alas though this was my last bottle. A charming ****\\nA coarser wine than the Pichon above, with higher toned acidity and a more granular structure. Good, pleasant wine that held its own. A good, solid ***\\nFrom a half.

Good texture to the wine. Possibly needs more time in bottle to be at its absolute best. ****\\nI don\\'t know whether to score this wine or not. When first opened there was an immediate whiff of corkiness. However, returning to the wine later in the evening no corkiness was present, but it did seem a bit flabby and with an oxidised edge. I am now drinking the rest of the bottle as I type. Again, when I first took the cork out (a different cork to keep it stoppered up over night) a corky edge lurked within the wine. But it disappeared! As had the oxidised edge! The wine I am drinking now is a delight of steely mature chardonnay. Wine left overnight like this usually leaves me cold (see the note for Pichon \\'92 below). But this wine seems to be living in reverse (if I left it another few days I\\'d probably end up with a bunch of grapes). Quite a lot of crystals are present in the wine (they actually made a noise on the bottom of the glass when I poured the last glass from the bottle). Scored as it is now drinking: top ***\\nBeginning to tire - fruit oxidising. Drinkable, but not for too much longer. ***\\nA joy. Not a wine that needs too much thinking about, but delivers what is expected of a decent twenty-year-old Pauillac. Elegance and grace, and with the clarety minerality of age. At peak, I think, but no rush to drink up. ****\\nI have quite a lot of this wine, and I have been a bit concerned of more recent times whether I needed to rush to drink it up. On this bottle\\'s showing, I need not have too many worries about that. Not quite up to the standard of the previous wine (it somehow lacks the breeding), but good nonetheless with fruit and maturity working well together. No rush to drink up. ****\\nA bottle opened the night before which LJM brought round on the off chance. Alas, not really fair to judge this wine in such condition. So I won\\'t score. Not Rated\\nFrom a half. Dark tarry, amber colour.

Authentic Burgundy fruit, decent acidity and a sophisticated creaminess to the texture - all very good.

As Paolo de Marchi remarked, there can be a problem with Sangiovese of the fruit maturing before the tannins. Bare ****\\nQuite mineral as Cabernet goes.  Rounded, easy, very drinkable, but without the edge of the Ceparello. ***\\nA bit higher-toned perhaps.  More tannins but generally a little bit thinner. Still nicely elegant. **(*)\\nQuite sweet.  Fairly sherried and very intense.  Lovely concentration. ****\\n\\nOne of those wines that is just bordering on the past it, but is still pleasant and intersting to drink: it\\'s possibly just that bit too oxidised, but this has given it a nutty character. **\\nRather disjointed and disappointing - a bit volatile. It might come together, but I think not. *\\nNot something to get too excited about, but with decent, sweet strawberry/cherry fruit. **\\nUndrinkable. Past it. Musty vinegar. Not Rated\\n\\nElegant, fine, fruity, long, long finish. ****\\nMahogany -  dry, oozing age, complex, quite challenging and altogether wonderful. *****\\nElegant, savoury, rather good. ***\\nReally nice - just a hint of sweetness - chocolate fruit.

Probably only for short term aging. A good **(*)\\n\\nWhite bread leaps about of the bottle on opening.   Nutty, dry, green apples - the fruit changes every time you come back to it.   A prestige cuvee that lives up the billing.  Lovely drinking. Easy ****\\nCould do with another year or so to mellow, but this is nicely structured fizz with floral aromas and refined, appley pinot fruit (it\\'s a BdN, I believe) with overtones of white chocolate. Pleasingly dry. Top ***\\nA blend of grapes from 89,90 and 91 - Cuvee 5, disgorged March 04. Fresh bread and apple nose, rich full yeasty and meaty palate. Perhaps in danger of being a bit coarse without food (as Blanc de Noirs sometimes are) - possibly a little more time in bottle will help. Complex and with a long, honied finish.  This opens up with a little breathing and is really rather good.  Top ****\\nHoney, yeast, apples - a complex nose and palate that repays attention. This still seems a bit tightly wound as yet.  My impression is that while very good there\\'s no extra depth of character apparent from its \"single vineyard\" status.   A prestige cuvee I\\'ll try again but I won\\'t be rushing. Bare ****\\nUnpleasantly oxidised. I hope this is an odd bottle. Not Rated\\nA half, opened rather soon after shipping.  Seemed confected and estery at first, quite citric but with decent concentration.   I think this is better than it initially seems.  Let\\'s say it is scraping ***\\nWhite bread and currants on the nose.  Light to medium weight - elegant fruit. Quite a lot of Meunier - which shows slightly negatively on the palate. Very good but could one ask for slightly more intensity without sacrificing the elegance? I\\'m not sure.  I\\'m being critical - but this is very nice.  (2001 plus reserve wines - disgorged June 2004 - I like the informative back-label). Very top ***\\nRich nose - chocolate, yeast, dense fruit.  Quite a weighty, vinous palate - perhaps a bit heavy at the moment and perhaps rather wood-influenced, but this might mellow with a year or two in bottle into something very fine.   Might even rate another star in its way but for now ***\\nTouch of white bread but mainly ripe Granny Smith apples on the nose. Pretty decent basic NV. Bare ***\\nPerfectly pleasant but a bit nondescript.  This has aged OK without really developing in an interesting way. ***\\nThis is rather dominated by farmyard straw on the nose an palate - too rustic for me in a way that I don\\'t think will improve with age.  OK, but no more than that.  Bare ***\\n100% old-vine Pinot Meunier and thus interesting.   Floral and perhaps floury (or am I being influenced by the name of the grape) fruit, quite forward in the mouth and a bit colourless on the mid-palate with an ordinary finish.   Real Champagne balance (quite dry) makes it pretty drinkable however, although it is hard to find much real complexity.   An oddity that is worth trying, particularly if one wants to get a grip on the grape and what it might contribute to wines like Moet NV, for instance.  Scrapes ***\\nQuite autolytic, appley fruit, complex an honied, quite dry and with good pinot gutsiness.  All this after seeming a bit maderised at first, but as often with Champagne this seemed to blow off. Excellent. ****\\nCitric, appley nose with yeasty notes - quite complex.  Ripe, rounded fruit despite the excellent acidity of the vintage - needs a bit more time though - aspects of it seem quite tightly wound still.   Quite long too and creamy textured.   ****(*)\\nLight to medium weight, elegant, complex and nutty, quite long.   Just occasionally it seems a little oily/keroseney on the palate but that may be the food I am having with it.   Really pretty good, although probably for drinking over the next couple of years.  A good deal from Oddbins at not muchover Ł20. Bare ****\\nA bit coarse on first sip, but this seems less noticable afterwards.  The fruit quality is a way short of Champagne so a fairly basic wine. Pleasnat enough. *\\nOne of those evenings with a lot of corked and oxidised bottles - even before I arrived there had been some bad whites!\\nLast taste from a nearly exhhuasted bottle (I arrived late).  Seemed typically lovely.  ****\\nGamy, succulent tannins. Lovely. ****\\nSlightly corky. Not Rated\\nCompletely shot - oxidised. Not Rated\\nGamy, warm berries, very pleasant - typical mature Beaucastel of this period.  ****\\nSubstantial but rather oxidised Not Rated\\nTo make up for the corked Rhones! Touch of game,  lovely ripe fruit, quite low acid.  Lovely. ****\\nChocolate, cherries, strawberries, easy, rich yet appealing.  Lovely complex palate.  Really, really top Port.  ******\\nComplete wine - really pretty good but so upstaged by the Niepoort.   Bare ***(*)\\nMainly from my own cellar, tasted in the last month or two\\nQuite mineral, but this seems a bit flabbier, flatter and lacking freshness than I remember.   I could worry that we have a touch of premature-oxidation disease here although the wine is perfectly drinkable.   I hope it\\'s an odd bottle, the one I had in July 2004 was fine and I\\'ve had a couple since which I did not note because they were similar.   **\\nNice fruit, very drinkable.  Quite luscious even with a richness that one might attribute to the standing of the vineyard.  Good balance too.   But nice though it is, I find it rather undemanding - no tautness, no succulence, in short no really grown-up qualities.   I\\'d hope for more excitment from this vineyard.  Still a fine drink, and it doesn\\'t sell for huge money either.  ***\\nA bottle drunk over two evenings as opposed to my last notr from the middle of a wine dinner.   Bright and attractive raspberry, cranberry and beetroot Pinot - a touch of oak and tannins but fundamentally in an easy drinking style.   Very pleasant drinking but not profound.   Will improve a touch over a shortish timescale but not a long-term wine. ***\\nVery (excessively even) citric, good acidity and a modest finish.  No sign of 96 oxidation.  I was given this knowing only that it was a 96 white Burgundy - thought it might be a disappointing grander wine.  Actually this is rather good for its level. Top **\\nOn first opening, bright, high-toned, delciously fruity - mainly red fruits - and with good balance and length.  Very quaffable.  Later, some minerality appears too and it seems stylish too.  Very nice indeed.  Probably for drinking over the next few years.   A very top ***\\nEven with decanting, still quite hard and needing food.   Stylish - I hope it will resolve well. ***\\nA bit reductive at first, opens out to reveal strong high-toned fruit and a bit of pinot animality.  A touch hard at the moment, particularly without food, but pretty good.  Top ***\\nSplendidly mineral and delicious. Bare ****\\nOne bottle rather orange an unpalatable - oxidized Burgundy syndrome, I fear.   Another quite mature and hinting at the same but still rather good and pleasantly drinkable. The good one: **\\nFresh strawberry fruit, moderate acidity, some tannins and still quite firm although the acidity is moderate.   Opens out nicely overnight but still has a twist of bitterness at the end of the palate that I have mixed feelings about.  Bare ***\\nBone-dry, austere at first but then just very classic appetising white Burgundy at peak. Bare ****\\nThe Champagne was the last wine of the dinner, and very good it was too.\\nVery elegant - specially considering this is blanc de noirs.   Dry yet very appetizing.  Bare ***(*)\\nQuite fine - creamy but a little sweet - lacks minerality and steelyness. ***\\nDumb - or not quite right - could even be the early stages of premature oxidation. Not Rated\\nTight, dry Meursault nuttyness, lovely acid, touch of lemon.  Very fine.  ***(*)\\nVery fine, balanced, complex.  Intense, very long. Still improving. *****\\nGamy, nice ruit, earthy, nice but not so long. Very pleasant mature wine.  ***\\nRavishingly gorgeous, elegant, fragrant fruit.  Very lovely, if a little light and perhaps no more than it ought to be for a Grand Cru.  Some want to keep this for 10 years and (probably) good it will be in rather a different way, but I love it now too. *****\\nLovely mushroomy nose, perfectly fresh, nicely dry.  Ripe but with excellent acidity and good length.  *****\\nCreamy and mineral. Excellent ****\\nVery mineral, stony and dry,  lemony, intense, very Raveneau. Starting to drink well.  ****\\nDelicate, fragrant, almost floral.  Medium-weight palate, succulent tannins gives some bite on the finish.  Bare ****\\nVery evolved colour. Open nose, rich,  hinting at corruption.  Slightly open palate that puts me off, but classy irony hints are rather lovely.  Bare ****\\n\\nA bit grassy and cloying on the finish.  I enjoyed this at The Square in London a while ago but it seems a bit dull this time. **\\nBright, clean, nice pure fruit.  Nice acidity - mouthwatering.  Scrapes  **(*)\\nOne bottle a bit cooked and plummy, another brighter and fresher with good density of fruit.   Not, I suppose the finest or most complex fruit, but nice.   The better one a bare ***\\nQuite rustic, light-bodied but quite intense.  Characterful. Top **\\nQuite leesy and rich - Chassagne-like.  A touch showy perhaps.  Top **\\nNice tone, appetising.  **\\n\\nFriends brought this round for lunch. Lovely medium weight Burgundy with touches of toffee, nuts and melon. Good to have a wine that doesn\\'t seem sterile in its freshness and isn\\'t trying to be any more than it should be. ***\\nAnd here\\'s the coincidence. I just happened to drag this out of the racks in preparation for the same lunch. This, as one would expect, has more signs of age - there\\'s also a slight dirtiness/stalkiness to the wine (again none of that sterility that can make some modern wine so boring). Good maturing Burgundy. ***\\nThis wine has been a bit of an enigma over the years - Toby and I have both given varying reports. This bottle, however, was exactly what it should be. Fresh and vibrant, sweet strawberry and beetroot, and with good acidity. More than pleasant. ****\\n\\nBright and high-toned. Good. **\\nNice fruit concentration. Good acidity. Bare **(*)\\nAdded complexity.   Fine length. **(*)\\nRestrained - gives the impression of being a bit less complex - or is it just a bit closed?

Bare ***\\nThe 2005\\'s all barrel samples.

Top ***\\nMedium weight with a lovely savoury palate and a touch (not unpleasant now they are resolved) of the vintages tannins. I like this a lot - probably has more time left than the 81.  Bare ****\\nVery nicely classic.  Cigar box and sweet, ripe fruit nose.   Follows through nicely with a high-toned palate.

Very classic and savoury - gorgeous.  Returning to it:  walnut nose and the palate too is like licking one.  High-toned again.

Clearly excellent, but I\\'ll not rate it.  Not Rated\\nStunning mix of flavours - quite fascinating.  Hints at an edgy volatility too.  Delicious but needs drinking - it may be a bit unstable.

Suave, yet dry.  Very, very long.  No hurry to drink. ******\\nVery ripe and rounded - silky rich texture and a long, complex palate.  Relatively forward.   I can see how this got its rave reviews from Parker, but on returning there are piquant notes too.   Top ****\\nCorked.  Not Rated\\nHopelessly oxidised - surely an odd bottle.  Not Rated\\nMuch more classic than the 90 - dry, flavoury with marked tannins.   My impression is that while very good this won\\'t become a star like the 70 or 61 - it seems a touch lighter.   ***(*)\\nExotic coconut nose, creamy.   Not Claret as we know it, but fascinating.   There\\'s great depth and structure and so this probably will be stunning in a while.  Bare ****(*)\\nYoung wine cassis - but Montrose minerality too.  Fairly ripe - it seems in a slightly softer more modern style than the later wines in this flight. Good though.   ***\\nLiquid minerals and excellent fruit.  Very good and will be lovely.  ***(*)\\nVery dense - a cross between 98 and 90.   Qute a monster, but perhaps some of the older wines were that way in their youth. Still, this will surely be lovely in ten years. ***(**)\\nMineral again but a bit more restrained and classic - less exotic than the 96.   I like it a lot - almost more than the 96 - very stylish and balanced.  ***(**)\\nA blend of 91, 90 and 89.  Apple and mushroom nose and palate - very meaty and substantial.  Big finish. ****\\nTwo bottles, quite different.  One very honied and becoming a bit austere.  One fresher with nice richness.   Both quite good. ***\\nPleasant old thing - it may be the end of a long night, but it seems just to be fading a touch.  ***\\n\\nNutty, honied, touch of herbs, quite elusive - occasionally has a certain flatness. Rather attractive.  ***\\nVery reductive but after a while in the glass, fragrant, sous-bois, nutty. Real tar and roses. Reveals more each time ypon come back to it.

Quite reasonable given that, but not really special.  **\\nLighter but more digestible.  Pure, transparent wine. Nicely drinkable.  Bare ***\\nVery deep young red. Timeless, in the sense that it is keeping well but not really developing. Smoky. Ultimately not so complex. ***\\nPleasant but a bit faded and disjointed.  Bare **\\nLabel mainly gone - clearly old.

Light, refreshing, noticably off-dry. **\\nA single vineyard wine. Floral, richer and better delineated than the basic wine. Very drinkable. ***\\nA special selection from various vineyards. Dumb on the nose with some yeasty notes. Very much demi-sec but nicely balanced with a rich palate. ***\\nCartizze is meant to be the very best area. Demi-sec again with a refined, complex nose and the sweetness seems in balance.  Quite long.   Top ***\\nStill Prosecco - it does seem rather featureless! *\\nA passito wine made from Prosecco grapes and bottled from a Solera established in 1991 (this example bottled in 2003).  Banana nose, elegant, attractive palate. Very nice. At least ***\\nThe usual zoo - bottles everywhere, great fun.

Top ***\\nPleasant old thing - without being particularly striking.  ***\\n\\nLike all the Gravner whites, a deep golden colour quite unlike most modern white wines. Jammy nectarine nose, rather red-wine-like.   Grapey peach palate, long and honied.  Striking and interesting. It has the structure (some tannins) and balance to improve. Lovely. ****(*)\\nA little diffuse on the nose by comparison - there\\'s some extra complexity from the odd mix of grapes involved, but I feel that is superficial and I prefer the honied purity of the Ribolla. Excellent again.  ****\\nHonied nectarine again, excellent but lacking the depth of the 1999 - also perhaps a touch \"flatter\". Still exciting. Bare ****\\nInteresting, fine flavours - again a lot less weighty than the 1999.  Perhaps scrapes in at ****\\nAt first very closed, on nose and palate.  Apples and pears emerge with time on the former and honey on the latter. Rather higher acidity. Very strong.  I think this will turn out well. A good ***(*)\\nA touch closed again on the nose and quite tannic on the palate.   Again I guess this will open up beautifully.  ***(*)\\nHigh-toned cherry fruit right through the palate.  Charming, nice tannins, decent acidity.  Very good. **(*)\\nRipe, very pure, cherry-like again.   Pretty exciting wine, needing a few years yet. Top **(*)\\nFresh, complex, lovely balance, this does not seem heavily extracted with its graceful elegance.  Very fine.  Top ***\\nI don\\'t seem to have tasted so much this year and the notes are hurried.  Too much good conversation!\\nVinous nose, floral and rich fruit.  I Good length, but it does seem very wood-influenced. No dosage, I believe, but it seems well-balanced. ***\\nA \"solera wine\" I gather. Yeasty, rather good.   I must try a bottle properly one day. Top ***\\nTangy, salty, lovely old wine. Top ***\\nVery fine and elegant with good intensity and length.  Unless it fills out, it seems a little light on the mid-palate.  Perhaps I am under-rating this - for now a top ***\\nVery elegant and fine - everything one could hope for from a second wine. About time to drink. ***\\nMedium weight and nicely resolved. Pleasant drinking. Bare ***\\nA big rounded, fruity mouthful.  Quite tannic and a touch awkward now, as this vintage often seems to be. Needs a bit of time still. ***\\nFantastic texture and density, really good. So suave. ****(*)\\nDifficult nose at first but opens out, showing silky-textured fruit with a lovely unforced concentration.   Should try a bottle properly at some point. For now at least ***\\nSA Portugese oddity - piquant, high-toned, rather interesting. ***\\nLovely - mouthwatering and delicious. Scrapes ****\\n\\nSeems rather evolved at first  - takes time to open up.  When it does it has amazing intensity and length.  The flavours centre around mushrooms and slow-moving rivers.  Lovely.   *****\\nDry, intense, long.  Benchmark wine, I feel.  ****\\nFragrant, dry,  a mid-palate hole but with time in the glass, lovely.  ****\\nClassic old Mosel sweety  -in pretty good condition.   A good  ***\\nDry, keroseney, long.  Pretty much dry, in the Trimbach style.  Excellent.  ****\\nRavishing, fragrant nose.  Middle-weight - balanced, long, lovely.  A top *****\\nMore sauvage, with bright fruit. Still quite tannic - could do with a couple of year.  It won\\'t be quite as graceful as the Chave, but it\\'s very, very good.   ****(*)\\nPorty - needs time - dry and flavoursome.  Top ****\\nVery fine, dry,  ripe but not overblown.  Classic Cabernet cedaryness too. Top ****\\nNice rich, grassy, good.  ***\\nFine, elegant, possibly a touch spirity.  Very classy but it perhaps needs to be studied carefully on a fairly clean palate.  Still, I think  ****\\n\\nA bit sulphury.  Sauvignon dominated - like an oaked NZ wine.  Banana-like fruit.  Bare **\\nMuch richer and better-textured. Rounded, moderate acidity.  Quite impressive.  ***\\nVery immediate hit of warm-climate-like cab. Easy-going - fine for a BBQ.  No great finish.  Bare **\\nRipe nose - touch of tobacco.  Soft - yet not overstated.   Tannins and oak evident on the finish. Not the sort of wine I personally want to buy, but rather good in its  way.  A good  ***\\nQuite forward - elegant - tannins resolved - dry finish - not so long.  Bare ***\\nLighter, but with some extra spice. A bit grippier than the 2000. Quite complex and structured - drinking quite nicely.  Top  ***\\nBlack cherry, high-toned, tannic,  some doubts about the underlying concentration.  Top  ***\\nVery closed.  Becomes honeyed and delicious - needs decanting. Provence herbs - bags of character.   ***(*)\\n\\nFine, attractive nose but the fruit while initially exciting is marred by a bitter twist towards the finish.   This defect seems less evident a day later - while the wine seems quite mature, I wonder if it might benefit from more time.  Pretty good. ***\\nCashews, yeasty bread, honey, creamy fruit - a different character on returning each time.   Taught acidity and good length.  Really fine - perhaps even ****(*)\\nBrioche and honey nose, quite citric (lemon and grapefruit) palate.  A little disjointed still but time will draw it together nicely.   Softly frothy now, as one might expect from its youth.  Very good. ***(*)\\nMost of my recent notes of this wine have been from a single case bought at auction a while ago.  I have since discovered from the nice people at Gosset that it is a 93+94+95 blend.  Lovely honey and apples with yeasty undertones.  Some will say it is showing a touch of oxidative character and I suppose it is although I don\\'t find it remotely a problem.  Very rich but now in perfect balance. ****\\nQuitelarge-framed, a bit coarse and difficult towards the finish - perhaps a year in bottle would help.  Ok, but I\\'m not wild about this. From a half. Bare ***\\nDoughy but floral nose, quite tight, dry and precise,  elegant palate  - decent length but with a touch of hardness that needs a year or two.  Very good.   Bare ***(*)\\nLost in my filing system - this is from dinner at a BYO restaurant a few months ago, but I can\\'t recall when.\\nMainstream Chassagne.   Pretty good.   ***\\nA bit woody - extravagent oak as often with Grivot.  Dry and austerely planky. I\\'m not so keen - others may like more.  **\\nVery pleasant gamy old thing. Drink soon.  Bare ***\\nOozes minerality, approachable but time will doubtless improve this.  Very nice. Bare  ***(*)\\n\\nRasins, a touch of oxidation, sweet pruney palate.  OK but unremarkable. **\\nLightweight, almondy, quite fine.  Picquant and medicinal.  Attractive as a lunchtime port! A good ***\\nElegant, lightweight, fresh and bright.   Rather nice. Top ***\\nVery pale - the colour has dropped out as sediment. Madeira-like nose, pleasant port palate. **\\nQuite pale, rather eveloved (the level is bottom-shoulder which might be the reason).  Rather savoury and delicious but   not quite what it ought to be, I feel.  Top ***\\nVery pale, mushrooms and biscuits.  Probably very old (some paper labels claim some of these bottles as 1850\\'s - if any are, it\\'s this one) and past its best.   **\\nFrom different source and showing up all the previous wines.  Lovely graceful old wine, fruity and scented, still fresh.   It develops in the glass and is completely delicious. Top *****\\nNutty, yeasty, lovely mature Champagne. Bare *****\\nQuite forward, slightly fat 98 style.  Completely healthy but for drinking.  Top ***\\nMineral, clear, fine.  A stunning effort for the vintage. Top ****\\nStill a touch hard but very fine. ****(*)\\nProbably substantially North African!   Bare  ***\\nLovely mature Claret.  Perhaps even a bare ****\\nDry, very smoky, quite baked fruit.  Seems younger than its years. ****(*)\\nGummy, quite intense, in-your-face stuff.  **\\nRounded, very deeply coloured.  Rather good. Top ***\\nVery rancio, cloudy (and still so the next day).   Rich and thick and with something of Ozzie liquor Muscat about it.  Curious. Top ***\\n\\nYeasty, very nice - Champagne quality although different in character.  ***\\nTight, lovely, classic white Burgundy***(*)\\nRather evolved - creamy marzipan.  Very good but might have been better a few years ago. Top ***\\nVery much real wine, this oozes strength and individuality.  Might well improve further. Very nice.  Makes an interesting comparison with the Roda: I prefer this because its much less international. A good ***\\nCassisy, peppery fruit.  Rather international, but good of its sort.  ***\\nVery classic, dry , tannic, high-toned.  Top ***\\nRich fruit. Elegant - seems rather good. (This wine passed me by a bit - I think I was chatting too much and concentrating not enough - my main memory is jsut that it was very good.)  Still,  ***(*)\\nSpicey,  rich, very M-C.   ***\\nElegant,  lovely balance. Class always tells. Bare ****\\nVery marmaladey, soft , delicious.   I need to think more about this - is it Tokay somehow as it should be, or is it turned into something else for the modern market. I\\'m not sure yet, and I need to drink a couple of glasses more contemplatively.  Still, it\\'s at least very impressive.  ****\\n\\nNicely shaped bottle, and reasobale stuff inside it. A bit coarse and woody, and a bit too sweet. **(*)\\nI think I\\'ve had this for a few years. It\\'s certainly worth keeping. Lovely honeyed and mineral palate. A joy. Just goes to show that you shouldn\\'t rush drinking Champagne! Top ***\\nOK, but nothing out of the ordinary. **\\nI haven\\'t had Koonunga Hill for ages. I was pleasantly surprised. Very Penfolds in style (no bad thing to my mind) - velvety smooth, not trying to be too big, gentle on the head. ***\\nGood nose, but not typical. A really very coarse palate. *\\n\\nRather fine fruit with just a touch of lychee -  not very varietal now, more mineral - some will say too old but I think its at a peak.  Pleasingly dry too - quite a fine wine.   Is this just age or is this old-style Zind before the days of extra residual sugar?  Whatever, it\\'s rather nice.  Top ***\\nTarry, fragrant, everything you could want from a typical, good Barolo in a decent but not special vintage.   Needs drinking in the next few years.  Top ***\\nRather deliciously smooth and fragrantly, softly Volnay.   I noted after a while that this had been tarted up with quite a lot of new oak.  Very good of its kind, and quite good even in absolute terms. ***\\nLovely old-wine nose, fresh fruit.  Coarsened after 30 minutes or so and faded a bit.  Still rather pleasant.  No indication on this half as to whether this was a Riserva or anything.   Bare ***\\nNicely made, fruity but not vulgar. Very drinkable. Bare **\\nNo excessive 2003 flab although I\\'d like a bit more precision and minerality.  Decent wine. **\\nExcellent fruit, especially given the vintage. Gamy and mineral. A lovely mouthful but the finish is a touch harsh.  Still ****\\nNice weight, attractive fruit but it seemed a bit flabby - maybe just a touch warm.  ***\\n\\nCreamy, fragrant, delicate, quite fine.  Butterscotch background to greengage fruit.   Completely fresh with a long finish.  (Magnum) *****\\nExcellent - tropical-edged very lemony fruit. Some oak I think. Nice balance and very rich.  Big - a bit modern but very good.  Aiming at the Beaucastel Rousanne VV style perhaps. ***\\nVery fizzy to the extent of being a fault.  But  it wears off enough to form a judgement - quite mineral and characterful.  Serious wine that I\\'d like to try again.  At least a good ***\\nLovely, creamy, fine acidity, good length.  Appetizing. Lovely.   ****\\nA touch closed and struck matches too.  Opens out - great concentration.  A top ***(*)\\nNice rich fruit, dry long.  top ***\\nStill red Pinot Noir from Champagne. So soft and silky.  Gorgeously round.  Easy-going.   One of the best non-Burgundian Pinots I have tasted.   Top  ***\\nBeetroot fruit - harder than the previous wines.  Very baked and extracted.  This is really not a success. **\\nLots of grippy tannins.  Highly-wrought and oaky.  Not my sort of thing - but striking. Certainly needs time but what will happen?  ***\\nVery fine - deep, rich, silky with a lovely refined, dry palate.   Splendid for vintage, but could one regret the lack of C-R typicity?  *****\\nRich pineapple, nice acid. Very pleasant. Bare ***\\nLighter at the final analysis - although more mouthfilling. Top **\\nBright, both metaphorically and literally. A touch hard on the finish still although coming round to drinking.   A touch short of the richness you might hope for from Grahams in this vintage. Still worth ***(*)\\n\\nAcacia, nuts.  Intense, dry, long. Drinking but no hurry.  ****\\nLime, herbs, cream.  Not heavy on the palate - lovely.  Top  ****\\nBig and muscular - grand cru intensity and rich finish.  Very good.  ***(*)\\nFragrant, piquant cranberry,  yet meaty (bovril) nose.  Excellent for the vintage. Partly on the basis of interest -  a bare ****\\nPromoted conversation - apart from anything else putting a wax seal on an Australian wine is making a statement.   A touch mineral,  quite complex fruit - pure too and not overstated.   Personally, I still find an overlying minty sweetness in the finish not to my taste although that might be less noticable with the right food.   Interesting wine that somebody with more of a taste for Australian style might rate a bit more. Still  ***\\nFat, nice botrytis, a touch of paint-stripper and not so long. Good **\\nLess intense, less flawed and follows through a bit better to the finish. Nice.  ***\\nLightweight yet concentrated.  Ethereal, complex chocolatey fruit.  Lovely.  *****\\nThese three wines were very kindly sent by the winery who had noticed that FWD isn\\'t always very kind to Beaujolais. I tasted these with LJM (sometime contributor to FWD). I\\'m afraid that these three wines still failed to convince me completely about Beaujolais. But they have persuaded me that I need to try a few more.\\nEarthy, fresh fruity zingy nose with a hint of vanilla - good texture on the palate. My favourite of the three wines for drinking now. ***\\nI\\'m afraid I couldn\\'t really get on with this wine - it seemed light and dilute and was a touch green at the end. Possibly a faulty bottle so I won\\'t score Not Rated\\nQuite a soft wine - maturity taking over from the earlier gamay vibrancy I guess. Initially a bit dumb and subdued, but after time the wine opened out. It would be interesting to try this in another couple of years to see whether it is just at a bit of an inbetween phase. For now ***\\n\\nExcellent condition at 10 years old, very good fruit too, although for some reason I could not get that excited about it.  Still a decent ***\\nMy last bottle of this - and hasn\\'t it kept well.   Completely fresh but fully mature, quite soft and very pleasingly drinkable. ***\\nVery juicy with a touch of Italianate bitterness to give it a grown-up appeal.  Finishes a touch abruptly perhaps. A good *\\nA glass at Valvona\\'s Vincafe, even so clearly very elegant, refined, blanced and generally yummy. ***\\nVery classy, loads of fruit, fairly forward, drinking very nicely. Top ***\\nOn opening, quite tough - you have to like tannins for this.  It does have the most fantastic ripe fruit though and 24 hours after opening it had really opened out.  Delicious.  Easy ***\\nThis guy is one hell of a winemaker.  This has concentrated tarry raspberry fruit on the nose, bags of tannins (which are ripe enough to be enjoyable even at this stage), super concentration and texture and a long finish.  High-toned, despite being a bit more forward than the 96.  Excellent. Easily ***(*)\\nWritten from memory a day or two later: surprisingly old-fashioned orange-rimmed colour.  Quite forward and easy-going, drinking OK at the moment in fact but surely more time can only improve matters.   Very classy.   ***\\n\\nQuite dry, fairly austere but very good, particularly with some nibbles. Bare ***(*)\\nMore forward and fragrant, not really noticably sweeter.   Good ***\\nThis is half Chardonnay and half Pinot Meunier - the latter not that apparent. Very yeasty, seems a bit four-square at the moment (perhaps that is where one sees the P-M). Rich and really very  long.   Clearly need quite a lot of time,  and I can see it could well be very good in a decade or so, although it might be a bit light on finesse.  Bare **(**)\\nCurious - very exotic, vanillan, and highly vinous.  Not everyones idea of Champagne,  but you can\\'t say it lacks character. I need to drink this over an evening (with food) and see how my relationship with it develops.  For now a top  ***\\nDry,  real Puligny, quite intense.  Not special but it does what it says on the tin.  ***\\nQuite rich, mouthfilling wine.  Lacks the classic finesse that marks out the stars. Top ***\\nNice fruit - pure, intense. ***\\nA bit more oaky - but quality fruit again.  ***\\nSeepage round the cork (under the capsule).   Odd but not undrinkable - clearly faulty. Not Rated\\nDepths, depths and more depths.   Really lovely, both rich and piquant. Very top ***(*)\\nBurnt, dense, exotic, meaty.   Tannic.  Austere, difficult.  This might yet come good, and even now it is arresting and interesting drinking.   Risky to rely on it evolving well, but if all goes well  ***(*)\\nAttractive green rim - never a bad sign.   On the palate, like a really fine old Madeira in every way except there is not the real intensity or searing acidity on the palate.  The flavours however are very fine and this is a lovely drink.   Top ***\\nChocolatey fruit - very nice old Colheita. Top ***\\n\\nPossibly a touch too old now, but lovely old Champagne nonetheless. Mature and elegant for its depth. ****\\nOne of the first wines I bought with a view to keeping. I love old white Burgundy, and this didn\\'t let me down. Lovely, oily, nutty ethereal stuff. ****\\nDisappointing. Not past it, but just not particularly special. Maybe it still needs loads more time to develop? **\\nLovely pure beetroot and raspberry nose. Drinking very well. Silky. *****\\nOK, so we drank this thinking it was showing well for the 1978 vintage. The label wasn\\'t in the best condition. The next morning I was just sorting through the corks when I noticed we had really been drinking the 1982. The last time I had this wine I was disappointed, and I was again this time. It\\'s OK, but it hasn\\'t got the structure or depth expected. ***\\n\\nStylish nose, slightly resinous - a bit thin on the palate. Pleasant. *\\nSlightly flat, flavoursome,  a bit rustic. Interesting, up to a point.  *\\nRich fruit. Lovely Burgundy.   Good intensity and structure.  Needs time.  Top ***(*)\\nMothbally at first. Disjointed but intense palate.  Emerges - needs  time.  Will be great I suspect. ***(**)\\nHonied nose, strong palate.  Quite evolved - ready in fact and needing drinking over the next few years, I suspect.   Even unflawed 96\\'s seem to be aging quite quickly.  ****\\nOpen,  peachy, luxurious. A little light, some thought, but I loved it.  ****\\nCough-sweet and smoky. Interesting, but slightly harsh on the finish.  perhaps needs time. ***(*)\\nGrenachey,  cassis overtones - quite raw finish.  A bit rubbery.  **\\nCaramel nose.  A touch rough,  perhaps.   Opens out - quite classically chateauneuf. Top ***\\nNice balance,  clearly warm-vintage. A lovely balance of slavours.   Coming round to drinking quite fast.  A good ****\\nYummy drinkability. Stands up in this company - if a bit simple.  ***\\nFragrant nose.  Gummy, rich, very fine.  ****\\nA touch woody.  Pleasant, persistent, but perhaps a bit thin.  Bare ***\\nBurnt, a bit thin.  Bare **\\nFragrant fruit, a touch hard, a touch of aniseed.  fairly lightweight.  Top ***\\n\\nMy memory of vintages of this Provence wine from some years ago is of the fruit being a bit sweet - this though seems rather good: Provencal herbs over cassis fruit with a lot of smoky cigar box.   Very much a point and it has kept well.  A little simple perhaps but I believe this was not a particularly good vintage for the property.   Good effort - I\\'d like to try some other vintages. ***\\nQuite concentrated and flavoursome, but lacking finesse for me in a way that I\\'m not sure more time will alleviate.  PLeasant then but not  fantastic. ***\\nSmoke and pepper - fruit gently weakening perhaps but very drinkable. ***\\nBlackberry and apple fruit with interesting sauvage overtones - once open for a few hours, very stylish indeed.   Will probably improve for a year or two.  ***\\nA bit stinky on opening - it blows off to some extent but a touch of something foetid remains.  Still, quite a dense, brown-sugar palate follows with a hint of volatility or something.   Good rather than exceptional. ***\\nFruity, grassy - like a new world semillon.  Pleasant enough. *\\nNice fruit quality - quite suave.  Decent length.  Top *\\nVery fresh raspberry fruit with a meaty underlay.  Very refined texture and good length.   Once it has been open a while it seems even more Burgundian.  It needs a bit more minerality or something to be truly outstanding.  Scrapes ****\\nSlate, sherbert, a touch sour as MSR wines can be.  Good length, maybe a touch hollow in the middle - something I find occasionally with the vintage.  Fine, but not exceptional by the high standards of the domain.  Top ***\\nQuite tight and closed, but opens out with time as it warms up.  Excellent intensity and a long brioche finish.  Good balance.  ****(*)\\nVery thin and dull.  Drinkable but No Stars\\n\\nModern-styled, but very nicely done.   Limey acidity.  Satisfying, but completely upstaged by the Jobard that follows.  ***\\nMore reserved, but much more complexity and \"beyond-fruit\" flavours.   Excellent.  ***(*)\\nDry, reserved, quite persistent. Rather good.  Bare ***(*)\\nOxidised - but it did have a slightly loose cork. Not Rated\\nSofter and rounder than the Lafarge below.  Still quite piquant on the palate.   ***\\nDry, fragrant, good length.  Fairly austere at first and less flattering than the Jadot wine.  Might till improve touch, while the Jadot is ready.  ***\\nOpen 24 hours.  Seems good. Quite mineral.  ***\\n\\nSold to me in Oddbins as the wine that beat Dom Perignon in a recent competition. Actually it might have been the NV Blin that did this - different assistants in Oddbins attributed the result to both wines. This wine is good, but not DP good. There\\'s a touch of sweetness and some heaviness of hand. **(*)\\nGood strawberry nose and pleasantly elegant palate. ***\\nDrinkable. *\\n\\nRich, quite forward (sepcially for the vintage), the quality shows in the persistence.  Lovely Juniper/Gin edge to the nose. ****\\nA belnd of 95 and 96. Strawberry fruit, impressive at first but it does seem simple compared to the Deutz.   Weighty but not so intense.  Good though for the price.  ***\\nQuite varietal but with an added complexity and some non-fruit chatracter that makes it stand out.  Drinking very nicely. Top ***\\nLighter and a touch vegetal.  A touch thin but nevertheless it is a wine of character. Top **\\nRicher again, as with the 93 you might struggle to spot the grape variety: no bad thing in my mind.  An interesting mature wine ***\\nVery fine, very characteristically Southern Rhone. Top ***\\nReally quite Northern Rhone-like and very stylish, gamy Syrah. ****\\nVery complex, smoky wine.  Really lovely. Scrapes *****\\nGamy but elegant.  A little overawed by the Rayas wines, but fine. Bare ****\\nBalanced and rich, but perhaps not showing ideally now.  A little more time might help. Still ****\\nVery creamy but not rich.   Dies a bit in the glass.   Interesting, and pretty good for an average vintage, vineyard, etc. Top **\\nDifficult on opening - gamy almost and austere.  Opens out nicely. Top ***\\nNicely set up and needing a bit of time yet.   I feel this hasn\\'t the fineness to be great but it is very good.  ***(*)\\n</ul>\\n'"

Specifically, the word chosen was the one that minimized: -log2P(bigram or trigram probability of word with previous words selected) + log2(edit distance of actual word with candidate word). All words of the vocabulary are checked as candidates each time and a beam search method is used that, for each step, selects the top 2 candidates that minimize the score shown above. That way for each word of the mispelled sentence, the top 2 candidates are selected and in the final step the best scored sentence is choosed. We us l1, l2 to balance the importance of the two factors (bigram prob and edit distance) and tune them to get better performance."
